0,Anyone who likes this better than the Pekinpah is a moron.,"All the pretty people in this film. Even the Rudy character played by Michael Madsen. This is adapted from a Jim Thompson novel for cryin' out loud! These are supposed to be marginal characters, not fashion models. Though McQueen and McGraw were attractive (but check out McQueen's crummy prison haircut) they were believable in the role. Baldwin and Bassinger seem like movie stars trying to act like hard cases. Action wise, the robbery scene in the Pekinpah version was about 100 times more exciting and suspenseful than anything in this re-make.",91
0,Author seems mentally unstable,"I know that Tom Robbins has a loyal following and I started the book with high expectations. However, I did not enjoy this book as it was too much work to follow his confused logic. I think that he was under the influence during most of time that he wrote.",50
1,Spaetzle Noodles,This type of spaetzle maker is easier to manuveur than the old press kind and much easier on the hands. The difference is that this new spaetzle maker makes smaller noodles than the old. It is great for us elderly that don't have much strength left.,46
1,Cool product until the cats lost it . . . .,"My cats seemed to be amused to work for their food. One cat would roll the ball with her paws and nose, and the other would walk behind her and eat up whatever fell out -- teamwork! I knew they'd dig this ball because I had already made something similar out of a plastic water bottle before that they liked a lot.A few weeks after getting this, though, the ball was never to be found again. I think it may have rolled down into the dark basement at some point and became one with the clutter.+1 for the adjustable hole sizes. -1 for the mess that happens when trying to put the food in by hand (although this could be solved with a funnel).",124
1,Works as expected,"I've had no problems running this with my Dell 8200 PC running Windows XP Home Edition which is running an addon USB 2 card, to which this hub (I have the 8 port version) is connected. When I bought it a year ago, I thought that 8 ports would be overkill and that 4 would be adequate, but I bought this unit anyway. Boy was I glad, right now 6 of the 8 are in use.",76
1,Not a bad deal...,"If you're considering purchasing this movie, I have to figure you're either a huge fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar, or you've seen the movie in the past and really liked it. Either that, or you're like me and you bought it as a gift for someone else, lol (although I did see this in the theater years ago and liked it). So there's not much use in reviewing the movie itself.As for the DVD release...you're not going to get anything in the way of extras (correct me if I'm wrong, but I think there's only a trailer)...but you do get the movie in both widescreen as well as pan and scan. It's of good quality, and it came at a good price (at least it did when I purchased it, lol).",131
1,Nice extras on the 300 DVD,"Good picture on blu-ray, but I don't know if it would be much different on DVD since the lighting in the movie is pretty dark.",25
0,Too Mellow for Me,"I've always been a John Mellencamp fan (all the way back to Jack and Diane). It's been a while since I've bought one of his albums, but I bought this one on a whim. I should have read some reviews first. I'm very disappointed. Cuttin' Heads and Peaceful World are ok songs, but there isn't a standout in the bunch. Too many of them are too mellow. Pass on this album if you like the older stuff.",77
1,just what I needed,I need t's like this to get through my days at the barn with the horses! They're great and thanks for the quick shipping.,24
1,nasty,"In 1880s Australia, a lawman makes a deal with a bandit to bring his murderous brother to justice. Simple story about the brutality of frontier life has direction, cinematography and characters reminiscent of the best 60s spaghetti westerns such as ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (1969). Viewers may also enjoy the similar-styled ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" (2005) and ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007).",68
1,"Yeah it's pricey, but it's pretty funny...","OK, if you aren't a die-hard Family Guy fan, if you don't like the jokes that go on for a little TOO long or the jokes that normally start with ""like that one time when Peter..."" this isn't for you...That aside, if you like all the side gags on family guy where they trail off to something that is completely off subject, this IS for you. To me, this disc is filled with the things Seth couldn't find space for in a Family Guy episode or that the FCC would have a stroke over if they did. I absolutely love Family Guy and the fact that they don't care too much about being politically correct...it's refreshing and this disc stays true to that. It's raunchy, just wrong sometimes, and pretty hilarious all at the same time.I didn't give it 5 stars because it's a little pricey for only an hour's worth of fun. Enjoy!",154
0,Not worth the money,"I'd give it a 0 if I could.I bought this toy last night after a customer in the store gave it great reviews. This toy is totally ridiculous. My 10 month old loves elmo. He has all of the other elmo dolls (hokey pokey, ymca, chicken dance, tickle me, rock n' roll, even the build a bear elmo) and a hand puppet and loves these. He looked at the tmx like it was having a seizure. He actually crawled away from it and didn't give it a second look. My six year old played with it for maybe a minute and then said ""Does it do anything else?"" Unfortunately, it doesn't. Maybe if it would talk or sing a song it would be better. But you can hardly understand what he is saying and it just isn't entertaining.Buy something better with your $40.00",143
0,You get waht you pay for...,"I've had mine for just over 6 months, and it crapped out. My Heier lasted 6 years, and I wish I would have spent the extra money to buy one.",30
0,"Sensible, average, but not innovative.","I'm pleased I bought this book. It provides a sensible and fairly exhaustive overview of the rise of the Nazis. But I'm also disappointed. The book contains nothing unique or original. In terms of fact and interpretation it is safe and conforming, and devoid of originality.Perhaps my standards are unrealistic, or maybe my expectation of a book by Professor Evans, a distinguished academic at Cambridge University, was too high. Either way I don't rate this book as a lofty contribution. It lacks the penetrating analytical touch of Michael Burleigh's similar but better work, and as the first work of a trilogy does not inspire me to think about buying the next two volumes.",113
1,A great comfortable pump.,"This is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you're looking for a slightly wider toe box. It looks great with a skirt or slacks. My only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable, and kindest to my feet, I can't find my size (6.5 W) in navy. I have the shoe in black. If anyone from Naturalizer is reading this message; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available?",82
0,way overated,this band is one long joke.aside from three songs this is spinal taps warm up band.i can't believe all the love they get.,23
0,Player is flawed and Digitalway does not support,"I was given the FL100 as a gift and soon realized the product is flawed. If the player is connected to the PC and the battery dies, it will corrupt the internal memory and the player will not restart after replacing the battery. The player BIOS will initiate, however, once the internal memory check is complete the message ""Battery Low !!!"" will appear and it shuts down. The internal memory can be re-formatted but the player must be on to do so. I contacted Digitalway regarding this and they said, ""If the player purchase date is less than 30 days old and you have the receipt, you may return it to the place of purchase. If the player purchase date is more than 30 days and less than 120 days old and you have the receipt, you may return it to Digitalway."" The key here is receipt. I also believe they are not really backing this product. I would recommend looking at comparable players and especially the warranty.",168
0,Religious Tone,"I did not think that this book added a great deal of real information that wasn't just common sense. Also, parts of it reminded me of a religious sermon. This seemed to be out of place and totally unexpected. The book was not what I expected. This book is great for the religious right, not the general public.",58
0,As Muddy As the Whangpu,"Alas, despite the enticing title and initially engaging, gossipy style, this book bogs down in repetitive trivial details while failing to explore fasciniting topics to which it alludes (such as the international drug trade in the early 20th century and its links to Shanghai and to international arms trading after WWI). Little effort is made to identify individuals as they reappear in subsequent chapters or to present a coherent historical narrative. This is one of the very few books I have ever simply chosen to put down rather than finish.",90
1,The Outsiders,"The book called The Outsiders was written by a 16 year old girl named S.E. Hinton. It takes place in Oklahoma. The main Greasers are Ponyboy, Dally, Sodapop,Darry, Johnnyboy,and the least ones are Two-bit and Steve. Ponyboy,Darry,and Sodapop are all brothers. They lost there parents in a car accident.Ponyboy,the youngest, and Johnnyboy , who is 16,get in some trouble with the Socs. The Socs are Cherry, Bob, Randy and Marcia. In the book one of the guys dies... but you have the read the book on your own.The lesson in the book, I thought, was that everyone has a rough life. All age groups do and also their classes. This book would be good for ages 11-16. I think this because thats when it starts to get hard for the kids.I like the book over all. The book was kinda slow at first. I liked the book beacause what you learn from it. It has a lot of emotion. I would recomend this book to anyone.",166
1,Global Groove Mask,"This CD has a great pulsating driving rhythm. The different musical sensations can bring the emotional force to its explosive peek, it isnt your regular ""bump and grind."" Put this one in your CD player and get into the Global Groove. Loved it. THIS ONE IS A MUST ! ! ! ! Take the mask off and let the rhythm move you.........",62
1,Great book but lesser in the series,"All of the Shopaholic books are great but this one was not as good as the others. Don't get me wrong it is still worth reading and leaves the impression that there is more to come but it simply does not compare to the first three books.Becky is even more out of control than ever in this installment of the series, when she meets her long lost half sister, who happens to HATE shopping. Becky with her overwhelming desire to be the best sister ever (because she was always an only child) tries so hard to get her new sister (who happens to be everything Becky is not) to be her best friend. The usual hilarity that comes with Becky insues and Kinsella once again provides her reader with great fun and laughs.Ending gives the impression that there is more of Becky's life to come... can't wait for another book in this great series.",154
0,Bad re-edit of a fun film,For some reason when it was released in the US this year they decided to edit out most of the comedic scenes and most anything not directly involving Jackie Chan from the earlier release. They also almost totally replaced the soundtrack with music that for the most part didn't match the scene. I like Jackie Chan films but this release was very disapointing. The only up side was that the voices were re-dubbed by I think by the original actors. The action is still good but the older versions of the film are better.,94
1,A greate book for beginners,"This book has a lot of general information about Tanganyikan cichlids and the way to keep them in a home aquarium. The pictures in the book have a special glossy cover, which makes them look very good. It's an excellent 'first book', but someone interested in information about specific cichlid should search for them in another book.",57
1,Sennheiser Headphones,The unit works well and has a nice long cord and was a good value. The ear pads are a bit small.,22
0,Worst DVD Player I have ever owned!,"This DVD Player looked good online and the reviews at the time were not that bad so I purchased it; however, I can tell you that this is the worst item I have purchased online! This system does not allow you to fast forward/rewind; it only lets you jump from scene to scene. It was manufactured very cheaply; its remote control is a joke. I am so disappointed!",68
1,Marching to the beat of a different drum,"I posted the book's table of contents - see ""Customer images"" link above - and would like to point out Chapter 4, which discusses ""relational data mining"", also recommending the closely related Chapters 3 and 7. (But not Chapter 2; the authors' mastery of time-series methods - if these do belong to data mining - is not obvious).I am skeptical about applicability of the proposed method, and would consult other books on neural nets or fuzzy logic - or Bayesian belief networks, for example, forgotten here - but others may disagree.Jeers to Kluwer for charging over $100 for a book that really should cost $50-60, yet not hiring a proof-reader. (""Daiwa Secretes""!)",112
0,not what I was hoping for,I had sampled this at a store once and absolutely loved it. But the bottle I have smells acidic and chemically and the sent hardly last. Wish I had returned it. :(Too bad I normally love their stuff. The seller was prompt and cool and all that.,47
1,Absolutely Horrifying,"I first read this book at age 10 and could hardly sleep for 3 days. I have re-read it many times since, and I am glad to report that it is still as frightening to the adult as it was for the child. This book teems with terrifying images and situations which I won't describe so as not to spoil the suspense. This was what scared me as a child. What scares the adult on top of this is the emotional collapse of Jack Torrance and his descent into madness. The relationships in the family triad are brilliantly depicted. This is a novel about the horrors of alcoholism, insanity, and child abuse, which are of course only compounded by the supernatural evil these characters become enmeshed in. This is my favorite King novel and I would really like to know what happened to Danny Torrance when he reached adulthood!",149
1,Great Movie,"A must see, great story and great ending, watch this movie!!!! Perfect for a slow Sunday afternoon or a could day when you are snowed in.",26
1,Great Value,This book was very heart touching and blew every thing I thought I knew about the Holocaust out the water. Great read for mature audience.,25
0,"This Cd, has absolutely zero point on this earth....","If you are a real house style raver, I suggest you consider buying another CD. I was recommended this CD, and I was disappointed when I heard it....The beats are not innovative at all, and rappers with the same style as Doc Ock, are a dime a dozen. Heed my warning and stay away from this cd at all costs.....",60
0,Not the OEM Unit that was listed!,The battery I received is not from APC as the picture and the description suggested and I was not able to return it.,23
1,Good LIve Curtis,"This album is pretty good. Its very energetic and the mix is good. Some excellent effects on ""if there's hell below"" This is the only Curtis live album I have and I like it alot. Some of the Keyboards sound a little lame, but dont let that stop you from enjoying this album. Excellent rythym section",56
1,Eats Wood!,"I looked at all the planers. I was going to buy a planer with AMPS being my first concern. With a 3.4 amp motor this planer did not fail once. I put this machine to work on rough cut white oak with the blades full bore, and I got tired before this Hitachi planer. My only wish is the shoe as in all planers in this class was 1 inch longer. With a longer shoe or base this would get 5 stars. At this price you cannot go wrong. Blades are a snap to change, and sharpen. This is a nice machine.",102
1,yummy choc. milk,Gave this as a gift and she absolutely loved it. Said it was the best choc drink she ever had. Great gift item.,23
1,Good book - recommended for everyone who manages testing,"I very much liked the book. Rex Black has written about the process and management side of testing. This makes it an ideal complement to Cem Kaner's ""Testing Computer Software"" (which deals with testing technique) and Boris Beizer's ""Software Testing Techniques"" (which deals with the fundamentals).I found the templates useful, mostly because I never worked my way around Excel to get those metrics in an automated manner. But don't expect them to be replacement for commercial test management tools.This should be a required reading for anyone who plans or manages testing.",91
1,MY FAV BOOK,"This is by far my fav book. It's very Sex in the City set in the 50's. It's very stylized and true to it's era. Plus if you like reading about show business, than this book will be fascinating. It's a easy fluff read, so don't expect it to be A Tale of Two Cities or anything like that!!! It's fun, just look at the cover...It's pink!",67
0,"Not impressed, but I still passed","I wanted to post this review, because I must have misunderstood the purpose of these CLEP books. As was indiciated to me today by the testing center, these books are designed to refresh the memories of people who have a good knowledge base of the subject. For individuals such as myself, who haven't taken American History since the early 90's, it didn't prepare me like I expected it to.I studied this book for three months, I had a 95% on each of the practice exams, and I barely passed this CLEP. Passing is passing, I agree, but just keep in mind that this book is a framework. There were so many questions on my exam on topics my clep book didn't touch on. Good thing I like the History channel.Anyway, good refresher, but maybe it's wise to supplement with a cheap high school/college text to be safe.",147
0,untitled,"I don't want to be harsh. I'm fairly certain that many people put a lot of effort into this book. I just didn't think that it was really a worth the effort though.Essentially the only chapter I found useful was chapter 5. Of course, one chapter doesn't make the book worthwhile though.",52
1,Beautiful singing!,"I enjoyed this group's previous CD very much, but ""Hoping It Might Be So"" is even better -- the selection of pieces is unusual and the performances are exquisite. ""The Oxen"" is my favorite at the moment, although I also love ""Quem Pastores"" by James Bassi (Why haven't I heard of this composer before? Where have I been?). The choir has a gorgeous sound, and the harp accompaniments are simply lovely. I listen to Christmas music year-round, and I think this CD is going to get a lot of play! I highly recommend ""Hoping It Might Be So"" to anyone who loves fine choral music.",105
0,Cheap copy,"The disk arrived in a plastic box used for CD's-- not a regular package. The installation directons, printed on the disk itself, state that auto-run will begin when the disk is inserted in the disk drive. Nothing happened and I had to use My Computer and the Setup.exe file to start the installation. About halfway thru the process, it stopped and would not restart. Our son (a computer guy) said the disk is a standard cheap copy type that we can purchase anywhere-- not the usual higher quality that Broderbund would use. Finally we got it installed on the main computer but it would not install on my laptop. I guess it's true-- you get what you pay for. This was cheap enough and that's good. If I have any more problems, I will return it to Amazon.",138
0,Disappointing considering all the high ratings,Gruen writes like a woman who is trying to sound like a man. Her word choice and syntax did not ring true and unfortunately the method cost her some in credibility. The book was nothing to write home about and certainly did not rank with anything by Erik Larson. The high ratings from other reviewers are puzzling. The reviews about the movie seem to more accurately reflect the quality of the book.,72
0,Try any other GPS software,"Currently I have over 20 hours in to trying to understand and use this program. I have paid my computer support person over $125. To date I have used the program and found that the route was there but not the map, the map and not the route. I can't find any voice for my Windows mobile device. You are never sure if you are on the right road. I'm so frustrated with this program! I really feel that I have tried to give it a fair chance.",88
1,Step up to this plate,"For fans of dub as well as jungle and drum & bass, dubstep is a terrific combination of these genres. And for those new to this type of music, The Roots of Dubstep provides a most fitting introduction as it features cuts by many of the better known musicians making dubstep. Personally, I find this kind of music perfect not only for dancing but also for working behind my computer as it is completely energy inducing, without being unduly distracting. So whether you have to write a paper, paint your house or just want to get down and dance, the Roots of Dubstep will give you the necessary step up.",110
1,Great travel pack,"This bag is nearly perfect. The straps easily tuck away, which is great when using the pack as carryon luggage for a flight or on a train. The front zips open all the way, so you can access the stuff at the bottom of the pack as easily as the stuff on top. The bag isn't huge, which is its greatest strength and weakness. I just spent two months backpacking in India and the bag still looks new.",78
1,The Diet Cure,This book was so encouraging. The self test to identify my levels made this read a keeper. I experimented with one amino acid for evening carb cravings and just like promised... there were immediate results. I haven't eaten at night out of hunger or comfort for 6 weeks. The biology is simple and the comparison of refined grains lending to addiction with not only food but alcohol was a game changer for me. I have a plan for a year's investment in a quality multivitamin and a list of supplements that make sense and are easily obtainable. I believe I will finally be successful in my journey to become healthy.,110
0,Very disappointing,"Sorry to say, this movie was a disappointment. Harrison Ford was not at his best, I expected better. He did not make a convincing cowboy. The Indians seemed to be rather lame in the movie. The characters were not well developed at the beginning of the story. A boring movie, the plot was not well done. The only decent part of the movie were the special effects, especially when some of the actors did their own stunts.",77
0,"As many people in the world I got ""Memory Stick Error"" (C:13:01) on my Sony DSC-W5)","Please be carefull, this is not a lie, lot's of people are having problems whit this memory.""Memory Stick Error"" (C:13:01) on my Sony DSC-W5) rises 1 month after I bought this camera, then suddenly It works again, but I'm expecting to have this problem again. My advice: do not buy it, at least until a new corrected version become available.",60
0,flimsy,Although there is metal in it; it is extremely flimsy and does not hold discs securely. A total waste of money!,21
1,This is one of the BEST books I've read.,I have ordered this book for Christmas gifts for at least 15 friends and family members.I'm an avid reader (at least 1-2 books a week) and I usually forget about the books shortly after I've read them. This book is hard to forget. Weeks later I can still recall whole chapters. It has touched my life so much and I want to share it with as many people as possible. I highly recommend this book.One year later - One of the books I gave was to a friend who died unexpectantly. We talked about this book so many times and now I know that she is in her own room of marvels. It has helped me to deal with her loss and to know that I touched her life with this book.,132
1,"Ask yourself:""Do i feel lucky""","A great game,even though you need to a lot of patience,but I guess that's what makes it great,couse even though you thought you've been to a place you can't expect the same things when you get back there.This game can really make you jump with fright,especially when you are really concentrating.Those zombies jumping up from nowhere.Wow.Don't play it when your'e alone,you'll scare yourself.Graphics is absolutely great.Blowing those zombies to bits is also really cool.Sounds are very realistic and sometimes really scary.You'll love this game no matter what.It's like starring in a great action movie(well except your'e a girl if your'e actually a guy,but a girl that can really kick butt and stand her ground).All I can say is.Coooooool.",118
0,Awful Movie,"The movie was a big let down, the voice talent and animation is a lot lower quality then the original movies, and songs were horrible.Plus the new girl Porcha is a spoiled rich girl who is mean to Carrie and Amy through most of both movies. I had bought it for my nieces but they started to mimic the movie by calling people goobers so we do not let them watch it any more.",74
0,In all Honesty,"This game has got great graphics, even better than the previous bond - Goldeneye. (I loved Goldeneye that was a great game) But.....the very detailed graphics have SLOWED DOWN the game. Compaired to goldeneye this game runs VERY SLOW. The controls are also different. The game play in this new bond compaired to the older one (goldeneye) is just terrible.If you have to choose between the new one and goldeneye buy goldeneye. If your looking for an awsome second bond for the nintendo 64 your going to have to wait. Unless you like graphics over game control don't buy this game!",101
1,One of the best,"This CD is so good words are hard to come by to describe it. Ricky Van Shelton's voice is perfect for Gospel music and the song choice's on this recording are great. I bought this from Amazon with the hope that because Van Shelton was singing it, that it would be good. I was not disappointed. This CD is great.",60
1,Not Just Another Rap CD,"I bought this CD because of one song-""What Would You Do"". This is definately the BEST song on the album. The message is sad b/c it talks about a mother who has to work as a prostitute to feed her son, but I absolutely love it. The rest of the album is ok, but What Would You Do is the deepest song on here. As well as ""Sista"". I don't like rap music that much but City High is different.",80
0,Hmmm when is the full saga coming George !!,"It's alaways the same, we,ve been waiting years for this to come out and when it does you think to yourself, shall i buy it..I have decided not to, not because i'm not a fan of Star Wars, it's because i'm fed up with, all the film companies releasing colections only to replace them with another special edition anniversary etc etc edition.I know that Mr Lucas is going to put all 6 films in one super collection and when he does you can be sure thats the one I will buy, so people stand up to these people who keep bringing out different and better versions lets just keep it sensible.P.S Bet the collection is in time for Christmas LOL !!!",121
0,"Without Owen Wilson, There Would Be One Star","If you choose to rent and watch this, rent a hammer as well. First, smash the DVD of this to oblivion and then whack yourself on your bean several times for being such a knob. Dumbness, lameness, lousy acting mixed with a lousy plot and marginal purpose to OK computer generated action sequences. Whap yourself again if you ever think of this terrible movie again. The good stuff of this movie would make a total of an amusing four minute YouTube video with cowboy Owen Wilson and the Roman general bickering. That is it. Don't make me break out my own hammer... Move on. Bad, bad, bad movie.",108
0,Disappointing wix filter,The filter had less pleats(18) compared to my old Fram air filter(30). More pleats means more surface area for filtering the air. The rubber around the edges were loose and didn't form a proper seal.,35
0,Bad quality USB speakerphone,This is a USB speakerphone of the worst quality I've ever seen. The sound quality is bad. My partner can hardly hear what I said. It is not the loudness but the echo. I will not recommend this speakerphone to anyone.,41
1,lots o fun,"This Game is lots of fun. I bought it to play with my family over the X-mass holiday. The only down side is that the cards don't say what they do on them, you have to look them up in the book which comes with the game. This makes for slow game play at first. However, there are 2 different versions of this game available, and the collectors edition has printed what the cards do right on the cards, plus the art work on the cards is much nicer. I highly recommend getting the collectors edition, it's worth the extra couple of bucks.",103
0,funny indeed,"Wrote Joe Nye : ""Alexa led me to the bed in the middle of the enormous room and pulled me down beside her. I kissed her breasts and ran my hand between her thighs. She gripped my shoulders tightly. Unlike the first time I made love to Alexa, when the ecstasy had been eroded by a sense of anxiety and uncertainty, I was sucked into this moment as quickly and completely as if I had placed my feet in quicksand. Memories from years ago blended with intense physical excitement in a driving, pounding torrent of passion.""Ridicule does not kill, but it can definitely lighten up your day!",107
0,Are you kidding me?,"This movie was abysmal. I don't understand how anyone could possibly rate it over two stars. The acting was ridiculous, it is amazing that Robert Duvall lent his name to the film. The cinematography was terrible. The plot also seemed thoughtless, although, having not read the book, I cannot attest to its faithfulness. It seemed as though the producers spent the movie's entire budget on payroll, as the props, writing, etc. were all very shabby. Overall, it is hard to even watch the movie all the way through.",88
1,Healing The Wounded emotions,Good all round book for the doctor or counsellor looking at non pharmacological means to tacklean immense problem in society today.Also some key spiritual truths as emotions are intimatelylinked to the human spirit.,33
1,The Heart of All Youngs Music,"This has to be the Neil Young album to savour. Known as on of the ""roughest"" of all youngs albums, with that said, this is the best by far of Youngs early recordings. Songs such as L.A., and Last Dance, will leave you loving this rare gem. This is the cornerstone of all Youngs collection, left for you to love over and over again!!!! You aren't a Young fan until you have heard or loved this album.",77
0,Dumbest game in THE WORLD!!!!!! :-(,"This is the dumbest game ever, no questions asked. I thought Sega would do a better job for a game like this! Let me explain my experience:Well, first of all, I rented this game (good thing too) and I came home excited to play it because I'm really into monsters, and creating and customizing stuff. Well so I played it and I hated it. That's all there is to be said about ""Stupid, stupid, stupid Amazing Island!!!!!"" It's a good thing I only rented it, because I almost wanted to buy it before I knew what it was like. :-( DON'T RENT OR BUY IT! DON'T PLAY IT, PERIOD!",109
0,It's going back!,I orderd this lens a few days ago and I am not keeping it. Here is my reviewPros:* Solid build quality* Fast and quiet autofocus* Well controlled Barrel Distortion even at 17mm.Cons:* After testing this lens for 2 hours. 95% of the pictures were comming out dark with some indoor pictures having dark corners even with my flash on. Picture taken at 2pm on a bright sunny day were dark and colors were dull!!!*My other L lens EF 70-200 f 4 (from 4 years ago) takes amazing picture compared to this one.ConclusionI think this is quality assurance issue. We are in bad economical times and Canon is getting cheap.Now I have to spend $20 to send it back...I am thinking that I am much better off walking into a store and paying the extra bucks and test the lens before buying it...or get a used one from 4 to 5 years ago.

1,Great workout,"ORDER THIS!! I was introduced to Minna after after seeing and doing a brief workout with the Fitness/Exercise On Demand Channel. After doing this routine a few times, I soon ordered the DVD and haven't been disappointed. It is an incredibly wonderful workout for fat burning. The added Bonus 15 minute training for abs really hits the spot (ouch! in a good way). I especially liked the Grace and Balance portion. Minna is concise and uplifting in that she provides a different type of cardio workout. The routine is not boring and very doable. You can start out slower if you need to and work your way up to her speed (which is what I did). I am very happy I ordered this DVD and you will too.",128
0,Do not buy this,"My first unit lasted about 5 months, and I had it replaced under warranty costing me about $40 or so in shipping costs and about a month's time. The replacement lasted about a year before it just suddently stopped working. The unit is quiet, so I didn't notice that it quit working until I saw the temp was at 81. I wonder how long it was out before I noticed? Customer service has yet to respond to my inquiry - it's been about a week now. Bad product is matched by bad customer service.",94
1,Nice Iron,"I bought this iron about two years ago. I'm forever leaving water in it, even when it's off. Big mistake as it spits water, as well as the heating element doesn't work properly. Irons aren't made to take this abuse, and now I have to get another. However, I'll buy another just like this as I love the titanium finish on the soleplate. I can't tell you how many times I've used fusible fabric, and it never stuck! Much better than any non-stick surface I've used. Wish I could get the iron repaired, as everything else works fine.",98
0,Not exactly symmetrical,"I would return this if I could. I thought this would have been a terrific razor considering the reviews. However, after a few months of use and switching blades (again, switching) I have noticed that one side shows more blade than the other...hence one side of the shave is ""closer"". Not sure what to do.",55
0,Dissapointing.,"The word that I frist heard describing Kelly's new Album was edgey, and if by edgey you mean full of annoying guitar melody's then it is very edgey. The lyrics are fine, but they would have worked so much better if they were put the good music. Like I said the lead guitar is just overwhelming and annoying. Kelly Clarkson is famous because she is an amazing singer, and I don't want to hear her overshadowed with guitar melodies and overproduced background beats.",83
1,Sugar Artistry!,"Wanted this book for several years--Gave up owning this book, due to being out of print with an extremely high resale price ($99.00 plus).

0,Product still faulty in 2008,"My husband bought me this tool in 2008 and it has the same fly-apart head construction that other reviewers describe. Mine even broke a window. The tool is so non-functional that I don't see how B&D could have put it on the market. They clearly didn't test it themselves. When it isn't flying apart, it consumes cutting line as if it were spaghetti. I would NOT buy another string trimmer from Black and Decker.",74

0,She's Lost Her Keen Eye,"This is perhaps the fourth book by Ann Tyler that I have read and I realized after completing it, I continue to look for and hope for the bite, the razzle-dazzle keen eye she had for the human condition found in her earlier work.Alas, it isn't in The Amateur Marriage. This book has a cast of completely forgetable and unlikable characters, mundane plotlines and conflict, and no real developmental arc to any of them. If this is her subtle metaphor for life and marriage, well, thanks, but that's not my experience and that's certainly not why I shell out 25 bucks to read fiction! I like real life portrayed presented through the language of a gifted wordsmith--someone who can take ""ordinary"" and hold it up as extaordinary--she's done that before! Life's too short and I'll probably not waste another minute of it wading through another Anne Tyler novel.",148
0,"Adequate, eventually","This tripod is easy to setup for hands-free shower usage, but the nozzle hangs too low for stand-up showers. In part because I've hacked in a much better shower head for the Zodi hose that hangs even lower, I also had to hack an extension for the upright to get the entire rig to hang just above my head (I'm 5'10; thankfully my shower hut is 7' :). If you need to raise the curved piece, a piece of 3/4"" white PVC tubing slides right over the tubes with enough support for the top piece and the shower head, without throwing off the tripod balance too badly.Also, on first assembly, we found how poorly the curved piece at the top was welded to the supporting upright; it came off in my hands with very little pressure applied (the other reason why the PVC sleeve became necessary; I have no welding facilities, and didn't think solder would be as strong as I needed.)It looks good in principle, but the low height and cheap manufacture work against it in my books.",179

1,Good Study Bible,"Very good study Bible. McCarthur is very diligent in studying the Bible and all types of resources surrounding it such as history, Greek, Hebrew, other Christian works, secular works, etc. Not a big fan of NASB or NKJV of the Bible, though many prefer them. In some cases the reading is more difficult. For example (NASB then KJV) magi-wise men, dissipation-riot, sordid-filthy, diadems-crowns. Obviously there are examples where the opposite is true also. Another place to look at some NASB changes is hissheep.org. A good, understandable KJV non-study Bible is the Defined King James Bible by Bibles for Today. Hardcovers are reasonably priced. Anyway the McCarthur Bible is a good and informative study Bible.",114

0,Moon Pool and cave diving,"I bought this book without very high expectations, because it was apparently published originally as a mass-market paperback. But I'd been told it had a hi-tech cave-diving theme, and it did turn out to mention several cave-divers I know. (But the scene is really a flooded mine.) It's not a mystery; you find out whodunit on the first page of the first chapter. I guess it's a suspense thriller. I found it readable, but the author's inclusion of lots of unnecessary facts in an effort to show off his research skills did get a bit tiresome. The author is better at technology than character development.",105

If you are wearing it casually, I'm sure it would last several years.",58
0,Full of Rah Rah Rah,"Here's all he should have put in this book, ""You can do it"" because that's all I found. Very little in this book was helpful to me, maybe that's because I didn't want to read a book that only talked about how great the author was and how you can do it too. Mind you, he didn't actually tell you how, but he told you he was going to, up until the end of the book.",76

1,Learning to keep Sabbath Holy,A Great read for those looking for the reason why to remember the Sabbath. This book is a classic. The body of the book shares why and how God calls us to a time of rest. Heschel's daughter's introduction shares how sacred this time was for her family growing up and the various ways they celebrated the Sabbath. I purchased the book to read a Jewish perspective on Sabbath from a beloved Jewish scholar and I was not disappointed.,79

1,70's Movie Not Bad,"Well for a British movie of the 1970's, this one is not bad, this Zombie movie has it all, nudity, gore, suspense, a graveyard, non beliving cops, but the best part of it all is how the zombies come to life, it will make you laugh. Still it has momements of edge of your seat suspense and ripping bloody moments. It even has an introduction by the director of the movie who lets you know this is a movie that should cause you fear.",84

Even with the limited camera placement options available with my laptop's built-in iSight camera, he enjoys making Legos and Hot Wheels zoom around the room.I have to imagine that software of this caliber would have cost professional animaters thousands of dollars just a few years ago, and I can hardly believe that we live in a time when it is inexpensive enough to serve to entertain a kid on a quiet evening.",90

But the ones I bought on line seem to be much more cheaply made than the ones I bought at a local store. They fell apart from being carried in my purse.

0,No Yo Yo,"I dont recall hearing much Yo Yo Ma during what I could take of the CD. Yelling and screaming followed by passages of instruments with unlistenable melodies. Every CD has songs that arent as listenable as the others. But thats ALL this disc offers. I was angry at myself for havinng paid money for it. Had I the opportunity to listen before I bought, I would not have bought this. I sometimes enjoy listening to the SDTK from Crouching Tiger, Flying Daggers, Hero, or other films when practicing martial arts. I was expecting more of that. I got none of it. Even the last track on this CD is a partial lift from the Crouching Tiger disk! its not even the whole song!! Thats the only track I recognized Cello from.I want my money back",135

1,Should have bought this before any others,"I bought this last year for my daughter when she switched to a dual-mode booster seat in hopes of providing additional protection for the car from the car seat. I had previously used several variations of a car seat protector but none offered the same type of stiffness as this one. It offers a little more protection than the softer ones. The bottom pad has a slight lip that curls up which I found has caught some crumbs from my daughter's snacking. With small children, crumbs are invitable but it was nice to see that the seat protector caught some of the crumbs too. My 9 month old son is still rear facing but using the softer seat protectors which flop down at his feet. If I had it all do over again, I would have purchased this from the beginning.",141
1,Good for Brew N' Go,"These fit the Brew N' Go well, but could stand to be a little bit taller. I like to use a lot of fairly coarsely ground coffee to make a cup, which means that my minimum volume of grounds is the maximum this filter can carry. Another half inch or even an inch would make a huge difference - there's certainly space in the coffee maker for it!If you're a normal coffee drinker, though, using fewer, finer grounds, this is an excellent choice for you.",85

1,Excellent desktop replacement computer,"This is not a lightweight machine and its battery life is a little over 2 hours. And it gets rather warm, and the fan is a bit noisy. But if you want a powerful desktop-replacement computer with a wide, high-res display, plenty of RAM, a large hard disk, a fast processor and all the bells and whistles (ethernet card, wireless, DVD/CD-RW, USB, firewire, etc...) and don't plan to carry it everywhere or use it on 7-hour flights, it's an excellent machine. I've been using it for 6 months. The first thing I did was repartition and put linux on it, and everything works fine under linux, except the modem (a winmodem, as usual), maybe that can be made to work too but I haven't tried since I don't really need it.",131

Even after bleeding the system perfectly, my car still whines like an old Ford Grenada in parking lots.

This hose does seem to do the job though, and so far my power steering pump hasn't failed, but I can't imagine the noise it's making is good for it.",83
1,The Best Video of Yosemite on Blu-ray Disc,"This is a grander view of Yosemite like you've never seen it before.Having just watched this, I can truly say that Blu-ray picture qualityjust doesn't get any better than this. Almost every scene is amasterpiece by veteran nature photographer Bob Glusic. Not only are allof the well-known landmarks of Yosemite featured here, but many backcountry areas of exquisite beauty fill this disc. Snow, ice, flowers,wildlife, walking along trails and river banks abound here - but unlikeother national park videos you've seen, you rarely see people. Nolodges, crowded trails, shops, cars - just the wilderness that gives youa feeling of solitude and being one with nature. You can choose tolisten to a narrative description and great music, or just ambientsounds.",119
0,not worth it,"I read this a while ago, and was thoroughly unimpressed. The plot is disjointed, the characterization nonexistent, the prose style clunky, and the book's attitude on gender relations is irritating and simplistic. Perhpas she had some interesting ideas in there, however, strangely enough (perhaps due to the clunky prose style) they all came off as shallow and undeveloped. Maybe some of her other work is better, but I wouldn't know, as I've never picked up another Tepper book since.",79
0,A Real Non-Debate,"As an associate of the Jesus Seminar I was disappointed by this debate. The two spoke past each other.Craig was impressive in presenting what he believes to constitute evidence for the historicity of the Gospels. However, if Crossan is right and the Gospels were never intended to be historical documents but, rather, metaphorical prose, Craig's efforts are as useful as arguing for the historicity of the little boy who cried wolf. He does it well, but so what?Because this matter was not adequately addressed, this debate was little more than two impressive scholars ignoring each other and making interesting speeches.",100
1,Well written and insightful analysis combined with engaging personal stories,"I found Free to Learn insightful, as the authors navigate through several different charter school success stories, highlighting inefficiencies in public schools and the mechanisms that allow charter schools to more adequately handle these situations, without superfluously extolling virtue. Yan and Izumi deftly touch upon both commonalities and differences between these successful charters - emphasizing the fact that there is no ""one size fits all"" solution. Yet, comparisons with non-successful charters are included for a balanced viewpoint. Lastly, the personal stories of those students lives affected or the principals and teachers driving positive change give this policy book a very human feel.",102

1,Going to Bangkok on vacation can be risky!,"I just finished reading ""Forget You Had a Daughter"" by Sandra Gregory and I found it to be one scary book. Young people take a lot of chances and this young lady took one too - big mistake. She should have just called home and asked her parents for money. That's what parents are there for (I'm a parent, and I know!). I enjoyed the book immensely and felt badly for the author who lost a lot of years in her young life to prison. Glad that she's doing well now and has moved on! On a lighter note, my daughter walked past the book on my dresser and was very hurt to think that I would read a book about trying to forget that I had her. I had to explain the title to her and I also had to interject a life lesson about the potential dangers of traveling abroad with drugs. I think she was sorry she brought the whole subject up!",165

1,Good ideas but it's definitely a future Hollywood movie.,"This is really not a bad book. I realize that he is manipulating his name and writing with intent to eventually make money off of a Hollywood box office hit but this story makes you think. His past books didn't really do that. Homelessness is running rampant all of our country and the majority of the U.S population (270 million) don't think twice about it, only that they don't wish this terrible misfortune to fall upon them. But many of these people didn't take to life on the streets because they wanted to. The reasons are diverse. Grisham is a good writer overall and I think for the first time he has attempted to make his large fanfare think about deeper issues than just about courtroom procedure, etc. I hope he continues on this track.",135
0,Another misleading item,"As many other reviewers have noted, this mount does NOT fit all or even most eTrex GPSrs. I bought this with my nice new eTrex 30, hoping I could mount it to my bike. Nope! Back doesn't come anywhere near fitting the new 10, 20, or 30 models. I think someone (?) should rewrite this ad to indicate exactly which models it DOES fit.

I was vastly dissapointed. Falling skies is an amalgam af the most clished ideas in science fiction tv (since we saw them many times before). Good heroic humans fight evil aliens. Add to this the unavoidable (these days) family drama between a father and a son, the stereotypical character of a ""heroic"" commander and a totally clished aproach to human emotions and you have one of the most boring science fiction tv series of the last 20 years (at least). But ofcourse there is also Terra Nova which is even worst!",113

1,A Brief Word,"I'd just like to say that the author who supposedly wrote the other book that is similar to Endgame ought to shut up. It's wrong to rate a book with 1 star when you haven't even read it!!! I don't think Nancy Garden woke up one day and said, ""You know, I should copy the author of Shooter. Yeah, that's a great idea."" By the way, who says that you didn't copy Nancy Garden?",74
1,Good,"In comparison to most novels, this perhaps deserves more than 4 stars. But in comparison to Marillier's other novels, I have to own I was a bit disappointed.The story does draw you in and hold you, but the expectations created by the Sevenwaters Trilogy didn't quite hold up.",48

These dyes are much, much easier to use, just squeeze the bottle. There is no mess at all and you can have more control over how much color you add. Also these squeeze bottle's make it easier to repeat the colors more accuratly just count the drop's.",83
0,Too sensitive,"After using the strips a few times, and pumping and dumping during those sessions after drinking 1-2 drinks, I decided to try it to see if it would detect any alcohol the following morning (10 hours after my second glass of white wine the preceding evening). It turned dark green-blue, indicating that I had a significant amount of alcohol in my milk. No way. The instructions do admit the test is ultrasensitive, sometimes being affected even by vapors in the air...but even in the absence of cleaning products or other sources of alcohol in the area, it still is way too sensitive in my opinion. I agree with a previous reviewer...use common sense, and wait the 3 hours for each drink consumed. This test is too expensive and too sensitive to be useful in my opinion.",136

1,Buy It!,"Though there are disparaging reviews about this book, and I can understand their positions, I cannot agree with them. The knowledge in this book is extremely thorough and the slow presentation of information makes it more likely to be remembered when needed than from such books as Back to Basics or Storey's Basic Country Skills.

1,"Does it's job, but the suction cup eventually wears out","This thermometer is easy to read, floats in the tank, and appears to accurately tell the temperature. The issues that I have had with it are: 1) it is glass, and my turtles have actually bitten the thermometer causing it to shatter inside the tank. This left little glass shards in the water. I imagine this wouldn't be a problem if you just have fish. 2) The suction cup eventually wore out and stopped holding the thermometer to the tank. Now it floats around and I can't read it without taking it out of the water.",96

1,I don't know why there aren't many 5 stars!,"This book is great! The storyline doesn't justify the genious within the works. This is the second book of Chuck's I have read (The first being Fight Club) and it is a masterpiece. I was a little disappointed with the end, as I was with the end of Fight Club, but I couldn't come up with a better solution. I loved the ghetto lifestyle of Misty and her family, because it's much more real than what most other books try to display as the ""typical family"". I also was fascinated by the character of Peter and his dirty little secret. I have to say, this is the only book where I actually despised the daughter, Tabby! Urgh! Seriously though, at least check this book out of the library and give it a try, I think it will be worth your time!",141
0,"3-wire configuration is common - this switch requires a 4th, neutral wire","A year ago I replaced a fan switch with one of those dial-timer switches which was very easy to install. I thought this switch looked a lot better and the quiet operation sounded great also so I purchased it. According to the manufacturer's website, most new house's electrical systems include a neutral wire configurations and since my house is one year old it did not occur to me check before ordering. My configuration only has a 3-wire setup and without the neutral wire, the timer won't work. One of my friend's is an electrician so I called him and he said that generally only timers for HVAC systems in residential building have a neutral wire setup. So before you order, verify that your existing setup has a neutral wire, because it probably does not.",134

There was not sufficient character development so I never got to the point of really empathizing or sympathizing with any of them. I really feel that the theme of the book had so much promise and was never explored thoroughly. A simple story with conversation would have been a more satisfying read than the way the author chose to tell the story. A definite thumbs down.!",93

Then Tehanu came out and collapsed the whole thing.I don't know what issues the author was struggling with, but it would seem that the tone of the book is one of bitterness. Judging by the harsh tones toward men, I can only assume a divorce or death. It is unfortunate, if this is the case, that the author could not filter her pain in a more creative manner, instead of wearing it like an open wound.I am very disappointed in what destroyed a wonderful series.",104

1,Truly A Stan Kenton Classic,"Trying to find CD re-issues of those cherished 78rpm records, some a long time broken, can be difficult. Sometimes CD re-issues are of doubtful quality. 'Stan Kenton 1951' is excellent. Although not strictly serious in jazz terms this album contains many favourites from Stan's halcyon days. The gymnastic contortions of Maynard Ferguson's trumpet on 'Hot Canary' have been long sought and the crowning glory has to be 'Blues in Burlesque', Stan's tongue in cheek tribute to traditional jazz blues. These tracks in particular don't appear to have been re-issued anywhere else and are a joyous find for a true Kenton fan. Excellent sound reproduction makes this CD a 'must have'.",110

1,,"I just finished reading Evans' The American Prophecies and could not put it down. I found it extensively documented, compelling and a must read for Evangelical Christians seeking to make sense of our current world. Contrary to other reviewers I have read, I do not find Evans a man of hate, but someone who is deeply saddened by the world events he has witnessed and feels a moral responsibity to let others know the dangers we face. In doing this he is well-aware of the attacks that will come his way--but our faith demands sacrifice. Ignoring history in the name of political correctness has cost us so much. The tone of some of the negative reviews reveals much fear and confusion about what is happening right now. While Evans may not be correct about where we are in God's timeline (only God knows), he is brave about pointing out the signs--I just hope even one reader benefits from his ""voice crying out in the wilderness.""",165

0,Big disappointment,After reading the Da Vinci Code I thought that Dan Brown had something special which lacked in other fictional authors.

However, I realize from the reviews on here that the dvd is very chopped up and edited, that is why I will not buy it.""Corazon Salvaje"" could get divided into three dvd sets. The first set would contain the first 27 episodes, and the same with the second and third, since if I remember correctly it has 81 episodes in all. These box sets can be released consecutively, several months apart from each other. Of course all with English subtitles.Hopefully ""Corazon Salvaje"" will get released in its complete form, soon.

0,My first 1-star review,"This thing fell apart after less than a year of use. First, it developed a leak where it mounts to the faucet. That happened at around 3-4 months of usage. Then, the chrome colored bottom piece where the water comes out fell off, so it was chrome finish on top and black on the bottom. That happened at about 4-5 months. Then, it simultaneously developed a much larger crack where the filter rotates and two pin-sized holes on the visual indicator window, so water would spray everywhere when I turned the filter on and even when I wasn't using the filter. That happened at around 6 months rendering this p.o.s. completely useless. It was as if it had been run over by an 18 wheeler, not just sitting on my sink. This could possibly be the worst product I may have ever purchased. Check my other reviews, I can usually find something good to say about a product, but I am completely dissatisfied with this one. I would not recommend this product to anyone, ever.",175

1,A Privilege to Read!,"Stephen White has written a very tight and well paced story. The characters, especially Alan, are interesting and compelling right from the beginning. It's clear that the author knows of what he writes, which lends a great air of reality to the whole story.

0,hard to care...,"Basically, this is the story of 22 year old Ariel, and how she tries to make it in the big city after graduating from college. She ends up temping while writing a ""trials and tribulations"" (read ""sex"") column in a local paper. A premise that could have been funny ends up being slightly boring. Ariel tries to appear as a bad girl, using phrases like ""he ground my beef"", but ends up having to make up the dirtiest parts of her column. And then, when she gets notoriety, the way she wanted, she whines about it. I just couldn't really care about the character of Ariel at all.For a more entertaining, and less graphic, story about trying to make it in the big city and failed hopes, try reading ""In the Drink"" by Christiansen. As for this being ""the thinking person's Bridget Jones"" (yes, it says that on the back cover), I beg to disagree. These are very different books. Bridget is purely trying to entertain. Don't ask me what Ariel is trying to do, but she certainly didn't manage to entertain.",182

However, I have read The Butterfly Hunter and The Japanese Corpse, and this is the man's style for sure. However, I have always detected something very very unusual in his work and something very very American here. The work rings of Heinrich Boll in places, but something intuitive tells me otherwise. You may find the vulgar racial resonations of Det. Grijpstra's work associates uninspiring, but alas.I've always wondered what happened to Frank Serpico. He did vanish to the same part of the world as Van De Wetering, and he was fond of this kind of urban detective fiction.

If you're new to TWS, start with any other album or your experience with the band won't last long.",66
1,Christian Card Studio,"Christian Card Studio is truly this desktop publisher's delight. Creating and designing bulletins, programs and flyers for my church is one of my pastime hobbies. This program has enabled me to create some dynamic masterpieces. For Mother's Day, I was asked to design a Mother's Day Memory Journal and I had just purchase a copy of Christian Card Studio software. I exceeded my own expectations. The output was truly a work of art. I have received numerous request to create similar work. I had previously used several other Desktop Publishing software, but this software far exceed any of my existing software. Christian Card studio allows me to use existing verbiage and or add my own personal touch to pre-existing phrases. The artwork is absolutely outstanding. The ability to create a personal touch gives all of my artwork a more professional touch. I look forward to purchasing and using more Christian Card Studio software.",153

1,Suprisingly strong story with unique claymation format,"A ""claymation"" Jesus? How's that going to work? Surprisingly well! While artistic license is taken (if you're looking for the real deal, read the New Testament), this ranks up there with films like Franco Zeffirelli's 1977 ""Jesus of Nazareth"" (seriously!). Caution to parents with young children: it has some very intense scenes and should defintely be viewed by parents FIRST. Well done, it was first shown on ABC Sunday night of Easter several years ago.",75
0,"Dead in a week, ultra bad return policy","I'm not sure of Amazon's return policy, but the manufacturer's return policy is- if this dies on you (which mine did after less than 1 week of use) you have to buy a second one from them at whatever price you bought the first one for, and then ship the old one back, and then they will ship a new one, and then refund the second purchase amount.

Overall, we are very happy with the Avent bottles and nipples, I probably wouldn't buy anything else.",80

1,"Fun, Fast, Enjoyable Mystery!","Fatith Fairchild from the fictional Aleford, Massachusetts is the kind of woman you'd like to have for a friend. Her habit of falling into mysteries and murders makes for fun, quick reading. This book explores the somewhat shady world of NE antiques, after Faith's house is broken into and a friend is killed when her house is burglarized. As other readers have noted, the ending is somewhat contrived but up till then, I really loved this book. Start with her earlier novels as Faith has grown from a new young wife, to mom, to mom of two. My only problem with these books? Faith's kids are SO good. Never fuss, whine, wet their pants at the wrong moment. Course if they were written as normal kids, Faith would never get anything done, like the rest of us moms!!",138

1,A gem of a novel,"This is one of the most enjoyable coming of age novels I have ever read. Based to some extent on the author's own childhood, it tells the story of a young Jewish boy growing up in New York City during the Depression. It ends while he is in the fifth grade, and cries out for a sequel, although after all these years (it came out in 1985) I doubt one is forthcoming. Beautifully written, if occasionally over-written, it is very moving and memorable. Anyone who had a childhood, or is not an alien from another planet, should find World's Fair to be a rewarding reading experience.",106
1,Obscure gem,"Outside of Tennessee few are likely to have heard of, let alone listened to, Melissa Webb's 1999 self-released debut. But, for those who know Bluegrass pickers, the list of ""friends"" playing on this obscure gem will clue them in that this is not some vanity project.Ms. Webb wrote 9 of the 11 songs on this project, and co-wrote another. Along with her vocals, these lyrics are on the ""folk"" side of the spectrum.Mark Schatz is on bass. Brent Truitt (Nashville session stalwart) is on mandolin here. Kristin Scott (before she married Wayne Benson and added his surname) is on banjo. Husband (or brother?) Keith Webb doubles on fiddle and guitar.",110

If you buy this, you'll note that there are no markings on the cable giving the specs. Also, a 60Amp fuse will give you ~800 Watts max at the amplifier (60 amps x 13.5 volts = 810 Watts).",90

1,Could have been a Cagney movie,"I had never heard of the story until the movie based on the book ran on TCM in the early hours of the morning. I didn't watch it, but decided I had to have the book.Very film noir feel to the story. If I didn't know better, I'd think Cagney's White Heat character was based on Chase's ""Slim"". The same ""Top of the World, Ma"", coupled with amoral sadistic behavior.At first it was a little hard to change gears in the writer's POV, from the hoods to the detective, but once you figure it out, it is a very nice read.",101

1,Helped Me Get Rid of Back Pain - Permanently,"I bought this book while I was on my way towards improving my lower back pain. At that time I was exercising hard, I had already lost a good amount of body fat, but the pain kept coming back every once in a while. All I did was introduce some of the anti-inflammatory foods in my diet, reduce or eliminate the oness that were highly inflammatory, and in a matter of months, the pain was gone. I'd say it's a pretty good result after over 20 years of pain. Now I can work out hard, play tennis, table tennis, do high intensity interval training, without any pain whatsoever. Just to make one thing clear - I don't see this book as a guide to a diet that you can go on and once you're done you go back to eating the stuff that's bad for you. The way I see it, the food choices, recipes and resources from the Inflammation Free Diet Book are meant to help you make long-term diet changes that will significantly improve the quality of the rest of your life.",184
1,Great Water Boiler,"The T-Fal 4-Cup Vitesse Electric Water Kettle is a great little kitchen device. Not only is it attractive, but very useful. My experience has found that it can bring one liter of water to boil is a matter of a few short minutes. I love my T-Fal Vitesse that I even bring it with me on vacation, because you never know how clean the coffee machine/water kettle is in the hotel you are staying in. The little kettle is holding up very well, with only a few scraches due to traveling. It has only failed me only once (hence the 4 star rating) when the kettle prematuredly shut off, but that maybe because of my power convertor, as I was in Hong Kong using the kettle. Definitely a must have for every household. Mine was made in France!",138

I won't review Mr. Chomsky's book here, but Mr. Bennet's book is terrible. I thought it was bad enough to actually write a review so other people do not buy this book. The message is basically, if you love your country, agree and support what your government does.",70
0,"A new decade for Mac, a new way to disappoint","There's not a lot to say about McCartney's first foray into the 80s other than ""whoops."" Paul tried for a DIY ethic like his solo entry into the 70s, but no amount of synthesizers or discotheque appeal can mask the weakness of most of the material. If he was going for Bowie-esque reinvention/trend-setting, he failed far worse than Bowie did during the same decade.Actually starts out pretty well with the funky stomp of ""Coming Up,"" the amusing ""Temporary Secretary,"" and the fun but empty blues ballad, ""On the Way,"" but the rest is about as spotty as it gets. If Paul wanted to try a new wave flavor, why not go all the way? Instead, he forces boring and schmaltzy ballads like ""Waterfalls"" and ""One of These Days"" upon us, and we're forced to cringe and wonder just what the hell happened. Nobody expected consistency from Paul, but dreck? You've fallen a long way, Mac.Best cuts: ""On the Way,"" ""Coming Up,"" ""Nobody Knows,"" ""Temporary Secretary,"" ""Bogey Music""",167
1,"Not normally a sci fi reader, really like this book!","Although I am not really into the sci fi genre I found a lot to enjoy. The writing was clever and pithy and the futuristic conventions were extremely interesting.

Instead he brings back a two-century old argument from design. His examples are few and stretched. Anyone with a background in molecular biology(or just a college education) would laugh at his evidence based on proteins. Its clearly a religious ploy to try and trick people into turning against one of the best proven theories in science. Dont forget, theory is the highest form of scientific truth! While Evolutionary theory will always be revised and improved, the core concepts will remain intact. Behe is trying to get us to believe that the entire foundation of a well proven theory is nonexistent, based on scant evidence and incorrect logic. Wrong Century Behe!",132

He Also doesn't tell you every thing a first time owner would need to know. I looked on the back of te book and found a biography about him.

Once the guard is in place, you won't want to use the door again because it slides completely out of position every time you open it. It comes out of the package all bent, and it takes a while just to get it straightened out enough to use. It may block the draft once in place, but the door must be open to reposition the dumb thing, and it takes at least two or three minutes each time. You probably loose more heat in this process than you block once the guard is actually in place. Worthless product - don't waste your hard-earned cash!",120

Thackery doesn't really change the melody from one segment to the next and as a song progresses, it sounds as if he is running out of ideas.

0,Mediocre at best,"I will not review this based on the book, as I was never a big fan of the book anyways, but on the film itself.Mostly, I simply found most of the characters to be bland and lifeless, with the notible exception of the villian Febre, and the plot and dialogue to be fairly weak and unexciting.The swordfighting skills displayed in the movie were dazzling, but (as another reviewer also mentioned) considering that everyone appeared almost identicle, it was a little hard to tell at times who was fighting whom. Also, while again the fight scenes were dazzling, there was no practicle reason why some of the more over the top ones were even engaged in. I am referring mostly to the fight outside the tower on ropes (why didn't someone attempt to cut D'Artagnan's rope instead of engaging him in an ariel fencing match?) and the fight on the ladders (why would Febre give up stable ground to fight D'Artagnan on unsure footing?).",163

0,Disappointed,"The Companion 2 multimedia speakers have been a big disappointment. I had to put thecpu on the desk because the cord was too short.

1,Be sure to get a FULL frequency transmitter like this one,"Before the Belkin, I tried 3 other FM transmitters that had 4 preset frequencies. None of them worked AT ALL. Maybe it's the area I'm in (large city, lots of FM stations), but the interference on the other units was horrible. I finally tried the Belkin and am much happier with it. It's not crystal clear like a radio station, but I get very little static and background noise. I can also change the frequency if weather, etc. interferes.June 2007: I've had a year to use this product now, and I would lower the rating to 3-4 stars if possible. Reason? Because the batteries do not last very long at all before I begin to hear more static (i.e. lose some signal power). I've found that I really need to use the cigarette lighter adapter for power. With it, though, I have no problems.",144

You'll note the lid is attached by a plastic piece to the base. That piece will break, just how soon. Also the lifting mechanism often comes off track and you have to put it back together. I rate this one star for the poor quality for that plastic piece. An expensive trash can should last more than a year or two. Now it goes to a dump somewhere to biodegrade in a few hundred thousand years. Might actually use it for recycling bin in garage for a while.",120

0,Stale Stooges,"The enduring popularity of The Three Stooges is directly attributable to the 190 comedy shorts the team made for Columbia Pictures (1934-1959), particularly the 97 entries featuring Curly Howard as the third Stooge. While several of these classic comedies are available on DVD, a few non-Columbia Stooge curios have turned up, including this title.SWING PARADE OF 1946 is a low-budget musical produced by the lowly Monogram Pictures, starring Gale Storm and Phil Regan, with Moe, Larry and Curly providing comedy relief. Away from their home studio, the boys seem to be a little disoriented; worse yet, Curly is clearly in declining health (later that year he suffered a stroke that forced him to drop out of the act). Rabid Stooge fans may want to check this one out, although it's nowhere near the level of their best work. Casual viewers in search of the usual boisterous antics are advised to look elsewhere.",152

0,Not as good as you'd come to expect,"State of Fear by Michael Crichton is a good read but doesn't rise to the top as his previous books.

That way you can enjoy tossing this book accross the room occassionaly as you read the erroneous one sided statements that are made throughout the book, and not put a hole in the wall. It did get my blood boiling a bit. I kept on wondering wether Crichton was being funded by the Bush administration. I still like the writing style...true to form.

1,A Departure from the Script,"This was a very good read, mostly believable, amusing in parts and certainly entertaining. I learned a few things about what religious Jewish people do to celebrate various occasions. Although I have some Jewish friends, none practice, so this was informative. I am not sure there are actually such things as female rabbis and religious gay marriages in the Jewish faith, but this was fiction. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the silly sexual descriptions between the husband and wife, and the wife and her gay lover. Does the author really think readers need a description, in order to know what happens between two people? That was the only spoiler for me.

Now, about 8 months since we bought it (and we don't use it that much, as we have a cleaning lady that irons so it's only for emergencies) it has become completely useless, the steam connector is leaking so almost no steam comes out and it becomes a possible hazard.I've tried going for the cheap one, but now I'll have to go for the expensive one.",125
0,"disappointing muzak ""dub""","Disk one is not dub and it is not compelling. A better title might be ""Bombay Elevator Music.""

On the upside, this is not music that will disturb the neighbors. Guaranteed never to break your chain of thought. One star for this half of the title.Disk two, on the other hand, is a collection of remixes of disk one material. This disk alone would be a three star album. Good beats, judiciously fat bottom end, cloying strings toned down and the treacle drained from the arrangements, it's a nice chill vibe that actually rises on occasion to dubness.

I had the feeling that yuri would be in here and all but this series focused so much on it, it made the rest of the anime parts really not matter at all. Plot wasn't too good, fights were mediocre even for the final battle. Thank goodness I did not buy this full price.

I recently bought my youngest daughter a Polaroid Digital 320. It takes much better pictures, and we're still working on the 1st set of batteries . . . .. In short, don't buy this camera.

The Mallorean had so many parallels to the Belgariad, but that was fine because it was incorporated into the story. Then came the Elenium, and I started to suspect that Eddings was a one trick pony. Too many similarities to previous efforts.Well, after reading Regina's Song, I'm going to say I wish he (and his wife) had just stuck to that one trick. A pretty cool idea was dragged into the mud by mind numbingly boring characters and execution. Some of the worst dialogue I've ever read; think noir meets Barbie. Finally, I was offended by the pomposity of the main character, who remains pugnaciously mundane to the highly unsatisfying end.",129

0,Never again,"I bought these along with several other pair from the same place. All of which fell apart within minutes of wearing them. The stones fell out of at least one earring of each pair. Seriously? Four pair of earrings and they all lost stones? I was sucked in by the low price for sterling silver and I got stuck with what I paid for. While the company was willing to refund or replace the item with no issues, I would never buy anything from this place again. I could accept one pair falling apart. Things happen. However all 4 pair falling apart doesn't say much for the quality of their items. I've bought silver from several other places with no issues in the quality department. If you choose to purchase these, I suggest you check the prongs and the stones to see if they are loose and try to crimp the prongs to retain the stones.",156
1,Fantastic,"My first Jenkins novel & I can only hope I find other works of hers as good as this one. I was concerned about setting taking place in such an old time period, but thankfully found that it did not impact the story negatively. The uber-romantic story line was perfect and just amazing. It had surprising spunk and wit & I frequently found myself cracking up out loud. This book somewhat reminds me of Zane's classic Addicted; this story was clearly not as raunchy, but boy was it hot hot hot! But it reminds me of Addicted due to the amazing story line that grabs you & won't let go. I stayed up until 7am to finish this book, it was so good. Excellent story, excellent.",126
1,A big hit,"I'm surprised at the negative reviews based on the web site. I've managed two of the Ceiva frames for almost a year now, regularly sending back pictures from Europe and Africa, with no failures or major nuisances. They've even saved me a lot on international phone calls of the ""Arrived OK"" variety, what with local web access numbers and overnight delivery. The Ceiva web site has improved quite a lot in that period but was never problematic.The frames themselves work well, much better than the 640x480 screen resolution would suggest. I think they traded resolution for brightness, and you can usually see the pictures from across the room, even at non-optimal angles. The resolutely-nontechie parents love them. I always crop pictures and resize them before uploading (the simplest shareware programs suffice, though I use Photoshop for more extensive ""darkroom work"").",140

0,Very limited appeal,"This book COULD serve a purpose, but only for those who have not yet kissed and/or are under the age of 15 or so. For those, the general information contained in this book, while a bit old-fashioned and repetitive, could be of some use.For others, however, it will accomplish little. Almost all of the ""special"" kisses contained in the book are either already widely practiced or self-explanatory and useless. ""What is a surprise kiss?"" ""It's when you are surprised by a kiss."" ""What is a grudge kiss?"" ""Its when you kiss someone else after being cheated on."" These are not new kisses, they're simply kisses grafted on to outside circumstances.The advice tends to be constant repetition that boys should slow down, focus more on lip-only kissing, and try to be romantic. Girls should make it clear to the boys that they like that they are interested in kissing them.Hopefully that saved you a few dollars.",155

The language is beautiful, the characters are so true, the sadness is profound, and the irony/humor is sharp. I found myself pulling for one character and then another.

0,I Would Like To Hear Mr. Legg Play A Real Acoustic!!!!,"Adrian Legg is an incredibly gifted player there is no doubt about that, but I think he relies to heavily on effects to do the playing. Like for instance the song ""Psalm With No Words,"" that song would have been great without his guitar all phased/chorused out. It sounds terrible! He also needs to work on playing less, because he tries to put too many chords/notes in a phrases and it just doesn't sound that great. His songwriting is okay, but I think his playing shouldn't overshadow the song. The song should always come first.Many of his albums are lacking in the creativity department simply because he tries too hard to somehow inject his songs with an over usage of technique. He should really let the song speak for itself and not subject his listeners to his effects and overbarring guitar technique(s).I like Adrian Legg, but I'm not going to subject myself to him, unless his music starts to speak for itself.",162

0,Disappointing and Amateurish,"The unconvincing plot, shallow characterizations and inaccurate editing would have been embarrassing for an amateur. I am left wondering if the real plot is to discover who wrote this. It can't be the same Dick Francis I have enjoyed year after year.",42
1,vrry good,"i am so far impress with the image quality, there are problems but it is a good deal for the price cannot beat hat,",24
0,The machine has balls,The writers are equally to blame for this POS. The blu ray looks and sounds great but the movie took everything that was bad from the first one and multiplied it.,31
0,Not worth the paper it was printed on.,If you want a book with better house plans just go to your local grocery store and buy any of the plan books there. It should only cost you a few bucks and you will find hundreds of better ideas than this book contains.,44
0,Hand Book of dimensional measurement,I really didn't like this book. It really does not offer any real good info on how to master measuring instruments. It glosses over different types of instruments with out really telling one how to use them. I can not recommend this book,43
1,How did all these people get in my room?,"I am a 19-year-old HUGE Sinatra fan (rare enough), and I would consider this CD the soundtrack of my life. ""I've Got a Crush on You"", ""You Make Me Feel So Young"" and ""Where or When"" are perfect, and ""Come Fly With Me"" is awesome. It wasn't the first- or last- of Frank's CDs that I bought, but it is still my favorite. My favorite song (My Way) is missing, but ""My Kind of Town"" is there... and being a Chicago guy, that's good enough for me. And for a real Sinatra fan, he can talk about the ""Bayonne Baccalas"" all he wants. A legend.",105
1,TRIP PLANNING DVD,"This is NOT the film that plays at the museum! That film is ""Rt. 66 AN AMERICAN ODYSSEY"" by the same film company that made this ""how-to"" plan a trip VHS.

0,Poor quality,I installed the oil cooling lines on my 1994 Chevy pickup using the Dorman Products # 625-107 and 625-108 cooling lines in February of 2007. They are both leaking again. I thought I would have better luck using an aftermarket product vs. a Genuine GM part (which I used the first time they leaked). I am disappointed in the short lifetime of the Dorman parts. We'll see how good their limited lifetime warranty is when I submit a claim.,79
1,Fun stuff,"This game was fun and challenging and getting your liscense to hit the road let smooth driving begin. The mini games weren't as fun but i enjoyed evreything about it. I'd say rent this game before you buy it,it may not be evreything you hoped for.But don't take my word for it.",52
1,Cool Crooners sound pretty good,"I got to hear the Crooners at the Lotus Festival this year in Bloomington, IN. Blue sky refers to the view one of the band members had from prison. That song and the rest of the ambum is very easy to listen to. The Crooners have a similar sound to the Mahattan Transfer. They sing in their native language so I don't understand a word. It is a pretty good cd.",71
0,I spent more money to see this film then they did to film it,"William Shakespeare must have been turning over in his grave after what they did to his popular tale. I have never been a fan of Romeo and Juliet (I think Hamlet is much better) but even I know the butchering of a classic play when I see one. Leonardo and Claire are good actors, and in this peice of trash they play a modern-day Romeo and Juliet. Even though it is set in the nineties, they still stick to the original script, even though half of it is cut for the sake of those who get tired of Shakespeare, (why they get tired of him, I don't know).Now I know that Hollywood has had some pretty bad follies before, but this film is beyond the area in which I draw the line. They should be ashamed of themselves. If you have to watch a version of ROMEO AND JULIET I'd highly reccomend either WEST SIDE STORY or the Franco Zefferelli version.",161

0,bogus baptism belief,"Our local used bookstore had copies of several of Jong's books. After reading them, I can see why. The sellers obviously found out that Jong is teaching a confusing, misleading message, and no longer wanted to have any part of him or his teachings.Jong's premise is that it is essential to one's salvation and freedom from sin(s) that one believe that it was in His baptism by John that Jesus took (""washed"") away and took on Himself the world's sins before finally carrying them to the cross. This ""water and Spirit"" baptism doctrine is a confused misreading of the New Testament. Neither the New Testament nor any of the Church Fathers taught this.In the guise of freeing his readers and followers from a ""works righteousness"" gospel, he instead burdens them with a quirky correct-belief-according-to-Paul-C.-Jong gospel.What other confused Christianities can we expect to come from the East?",146
1,Definitely worth the 4 bucks! seriously,I havr a pair of Klipsch earbuds and I had the plug go bad so I looked for a replacement. I tried both the screw and solder terminal versions of the gold plug replacement from radion shack but the don't really hold the wire still after attached and didn't feel solid. This on the over hand was relatively easy to solder and with the extra support that pinches the wire its a lot better. Still great quality sound as long as you make the proper preparations (burn/scrap/sand off enamel of wires etc). Definitely worth the 4 dollars to save me over 80,102

I was fortunate enough, and patient enough to watch an Antalope mon with her two young ones, about six months old. I saw sone activity and focused in and got me a fantastic shot of those two young fawns dipping under mom and starting to nurse. WOW! I'll say if you want to get close, and closer, get a good camera with a large number zoom. The SP-550UZ 7.1MP Digital Camera with Dual Image Stabilizer 18X Optical Zoom is doing it for me. It can do it for you too.",121

1,I now understand the Elmo rage,"This set was a gift from my 4-yr-old son's favorite auntie, and within a couple weeks we knew every line by heart. He just loves Elmo and the whole cast, who are each exciting and interesting as only a little, red, furry monster can be to a child. (Wait ... that's another episode ... involving a parade ...)Anyway, Elmo is a great educational tool and my son's personal favorite character in the known universe ... well, it's a tie between Elmo, Mr Noodle and Dorothy. And since my son has only been in the U.S. for two months and doesn't speak much English yet, that is definitely saying something.My highest recommendation.",111
0,Not a good textbook,"I would not recommend this textbook to someone who wants to learn the FUNDAMENTALS of C++. The textbook does not really cover the basis of algorithms and how to structure your code. It simply gives brief explanations to principles, and provides a few examples of sample computer codes. Don't waste your time and money with this textbook.",57

0,The Emperors new clothes,"This book was a waste of money. Not only were the tips and tricks vague and largely incorrect, judging from the Authors images, he did NOT spend any time learning this program.

0,"Overtaken by events, do not waste your money",After I read the book I Google Michael Scott Speicher. He never survived the initial crash and his body was recovered in 2009 which means the entire book was speculation that was proved to be wrong.

1,There is not enough Batman...,"I must say that the animation work is great and you going to see a Batman like you see him in Comics, with great detail and excellent development, however the price to pay is that you don't get enough of this version of Batman. With the exception of the first episode, which is, also the most ""diferent"" of the conceptions of Batman, the all others are great job... so great that at the end of each chapter, they keep you waiting for more... which is a little frustrating, because there is no more.However, if you are a true fan of Batman, you should get this one, it's a great job.",110
0,Mars needs Moms Blu ray,"What the second reviewer overlooked is that the Martians KILL yes KILL the mothers after they suck the life out of them. This plot point was not needed. This movie is NOT about family values. The reason it failed is because it's a bad movie. John Lassiter, what were you thinking?PS I would be horrified if I had a kid there at the movies who had to witness a Mom getting the life sucked out of her until she explodes(dies). Think about it. If you liked that I bet you liked Eight Below where half the sled dogs freeze to death. Another Disney non Family values movie.",107
0,Look cool- but functionall Crappy- Poor battery Life,"I wanted so bad to like this company. Seemingly cool looking products. I like design, and Vessels products have the aesthetic I'm after. I bought the 4-set of Candelas in the Moma store in NYC, after charging them for 24 hours, 2 of the 4 did not work for longer than 3 minutes. I returned them to the store. 3 weeks later, 2 of the new Candelas started diminishing 10x faster than the other 2. I then contacted Vessel, who was surprisingly unfriendly and not very helpful. After a vigorous letter, I received 2 replacement Candelas (i marked them on the bottom) which lasted- get this- 2 weeks before fading out after 10 minutes. I sent the whole thing back to Vessel - who told me without the original receipt, could not refund me. I promptly told them to keep them. Terrible business practices, and useless product. How can a company like this stay in business>?",156

1,Great For Young Kids,"A silly movie I loved as a kid. I bought the DVD for myself. I put it on ready to enjoy a childhood favorite, and I could sit through it once and only once. Not quite as good as I had remembered, as with many things loved in childhood. My daughter on the other hand loves it, so not a total waste. Since I loved it as a kid and now my daughter loves it, I would say it's a great movie for kids. It's very entertaining for them. As for adults or young adults, unless you loved it as a child, there's not much of a plot but no shortage of cheese. The enjoyment is more sentimental and nostalgic. It's Jim Henson puppets, I mean really, how many serious adults sit around enjoying Sesame Street.No, there's nothing perverse about the movie (as I read in some reviews). And no, you don't have to be on drugs or crazy to enjoy it, just young or young at heart accompanied by a great imagination.",173
1,broad and indepth coverage of terms,Attractive display: both broad and indepth.

1,Very Accurate BP Monitor!,"This monitor is very accurate,and for the past month has been within 5 points of my doctors mercury blood pressure monitor. The only drawback: it cannot store independent data for two persons,which may be ideal for couples. The hand positioning sensor is also a great addition that improves the accuracy of the readings.I would highly recommend this monitor to anyone.",60
0,A call to arms rather than a diet book,"This book has very little to do with dieting and much more to do with attacking the ranching industries and promoting a vegan lifestyle. It attempts to gross the reader out with images of eating ""carcasses"" and sucking on your mother's breast in order to convince the reader that meat and any of its byproducts are unhealthy. This book is a bait and switch and a complete waste of time and money. If I wanted a book on the politics of the meat industry, I would have bought one.",89
0,"A cheap, plantation, redneck, ""CARRIE""","Hmmm, this was a horrible novel. It's like rich, plantation owner, meets a ""carrie white"" from backwoods alabama. It is horribly unoriginal, written on a second graders reading level...the most complicated word was probably telekinesis...however, the deaths were slightly exciting.",40
1,Great item,"I recently bought this item and I am quite happy with it. If you buy an Apple Cradle it's about $40 and add a USB 2.0 5-port Hub (which by the way most of them are really ugly and only 4-port) for $20 it's already a bit higher than buying this single device that helps you avoid clutter on your desktop as well.Pros: no cable clutter, slim design, cradle for ipod and usb 2.0-hub, audio out, usb 1.1 and 2.0 compatible.Cons: The leds on the front are a bit flashy for my taste, ipod re-connects and goes to ""do not disconnect"" mode every time I power up any other ac-powered devices connected to the hub.Overall: Good device, great price.",119

0,The little white horse,"Based on a storyline from the 1800's, this book, in this day and age, is verging on child pornography, child neglect and promiscuous language. I can see its value for literary purposes with much expressive language, however, the heroine of this book is 13yrs old at the beginning of the book, is treated as a child throughout, the story advances by just days at a time and yet in the end she marries in the next spring at the age of 13 or 14yrs. Some of the language used is so 1940's and has developed alternate meanings over the time frame of 60+ years. Some very good escapist scenes, however, it will be interesting to see what they do to this novel to clean it up for the 21st century movie that is planned. When there are so many other thousands of good storylines to choose from, why did movie makers choose this one?",154
1,This motion picture is dedicated to the massacre victims in Aurora Colorado,"The news was heard all around the globe when The Dark Knight Rises opened in theatres in late July the 20th, there was this bloody shootout inside the auditorium. There was one survivor whom I believed was playing dead, that was cool and smart thinking; but let us not forget the victims who did not make it out alive, for we are truly sorry for the loss of lives in that one single night.I am not exactly a Canadian, I am from London England. Doesn't matter, quite honestly, I was pretty darn scared myself if I went to see the movie on opening night, so I just told my friends and sibling that I was scared myself, knowing that The Dark Knight Rises was truly a masterpiece, last one in the trilogy and not to be missed. Amen.",138
1,"Touches not only the heart, but the soul......","This was her first book I've ever read and then I picked up each one of her's that I could get my hands on! Every scene is magical and mostly in its reality. It tells us as to how every turn our life ultimately takes us as to where we were meant to be all along. You fall in love with each character, each emotion and each memory. It is the most precious book in my collection, which taught me a lesson: ""When you are flat on your back, there is nowhere to look, but up."" Thanx to Susan Elizabeth Phillips, who kept me up all night, crying and laughing, and taught me true perseverance. A must read for all those who'd love to fall in love. These characters were made for us!",133
0,Everything old is new again,"The Matrix takes on a future world where mind experiences are induced by software, not the senses. This premise ought to have been fascinating, but this very Hollywood treatment is nothing but an old fashioned shoot-em-up, with silly kung fu fights, hilarious logical inconsistencies, and a cinematic superhero who, true to formula, finds his magical powers just in time. Ho hum. Skip this one unless you like assault rifles discharging ammo by the bushel.",74
1,Just what you're looking for!,"MUSE is such an amazing band, extracting pure melancholy from the heart and transforming it into musical form. SHOWBIZ, the bands first album, is remarkably diverse and intricate. Kicking off the CD is ""Sunburn"", and one can not ask for a better opening track. Every track on here is worth the money. ""Muscle Museum"" and ""Fillip"" prove the emotion and passion that is rooted within Matt's voice and the bands overall talent. Other beauties such as ""Falling Down"", ""Cave"", and ""Overdue"" round out the exquisiteness of such an album. I cannot praise this enough! Muse is without question one of the best bands today. You will not be disappointed!",109
0,Bitter,"I wish I hadn't read this book. I was always in awe of Chyna and the power and confidence that she portrayed. However, after reading this book, I now realize that she is nothing but bitter and sarcastic about her accomplishments and fame. Almost every sentence had sarcasm in it as well as bitterness towards each event in her life. I finished the book and my whole attitude towards Chyna had been tarnished. I am not proud of her anymore. I feel like she is who she is now just to spite something or someone. And that is just not respectable at all.",103

By the time the camera actually takes the picture, my kids have turned away. But without the red eye reduction, everyone's eyes are big and red. I never had a problem with my Ricoh. Every picture came out perfect so I don't think it's my fault. Anyways, I'm returning this camera and searching for a new Ricoh!",113

One really has to hear it to believe it. They are an American band that isn't afraid to try on different sounds, breaking in a culture different from their own. It's a soild ablum, and really fun to listen to. If your into surprises, and philosophy this album is for you. They go deep lyrically, and mix in a shocking, fun vibe of sound.",93

I'd read it again and definitely worth buying.",61
0,Wanted: A Groove of My Own,"This is not the worst album I've ever heard, but it is an album I have heard several hundred times before I actually popped it in my disc player. Jenny has a decent voice, and the backing tracks are professional, but Jenny is still lacking her own voice. Listen closely: There's a little Natalie Merchant there, a bit of Alanis there, and a sprinkle of Counting Crows over there. Her songs often follow the same patterns, and her vocal choices tend toward the gimmicky. Jenny has an excellent chance to evolve, but this album is sad evidence that she might be too busy following in others' footsteps to forge her own trail.Too bad.",113

The problem is it was extremely difficult to assemble. In fact, I almost returned it because the sides just wouldn't connect. After trying several times and using a hammer and sitting on it, we managed to get 3 sides assembled and it was enough to hold it. We decided to keep it rather than go through the hassle of returning it. After all the abuse it took to assemble it, I think it will hold up to anything a child could do to it.",107
1,a pleasant little book . . .,"with, as other reviewers pointed out, a nice selection of practical exercises, like holding a rubber band or some other talisman when you get angry (to remind yourself that almost everyone gets angry and has to get over it), concentrating on one or two words when praying, and trying to think about the positive good you can help create when you are engaged in social action (rather than on who you are angry at for creating the problem).",78

1,You might even see yourself!,"Bitter irony abounds in this poolside read, yet the entertaining antics of the characters are oftentimes true to life. You might even think the author is writing about people you know, or even yourself! The author has concocted a devilish take on human nature that makes you wonder--if a faux dog person prides themselves on getting a dog that acts like a cat, why not simply get a cat in the first place?? You'll have to read it to know what I mean. Highly recommended.",85

It is surely forthcoming. Needless to say, don't wait for my review to buy this record. IT IS AWESOME. A fusion of styles and textures that is immediately accesible on the first listen. A great record, from front to back, that improves with each track. God I love records like that. This is one of those records where all your friends will ask you ""Who is this?"", and you'll feel like your the man because you are on the leading edge... Music Kills Me is multi-layered with great intensity. And I love the fusion of rock and electronica! A must for anyone who takes partying and living life large as serious business. Stay tuned folks.",161
0,Pretty mediocre read,"Debbie MaComber is usually alot better than this latest book. The dialogue is stiff and at times unbelievable. It reminds me of a novice writer that hasn't quite got their writing technique down. It also reminds me of Sandra Brown's very early works, pretty boring and poorly written. I'm trying to get through this thing, I do not recommend it to anyone. This writer was in a big hurry when she ""wrote"" this one. I bet I could do as good. YUCK!!!",82
0,Confessions of an S.O.B.,"Talk about self-absorbed...I guess the ego and the love of self this man displays are essential to success in business...I thought the man made some good points, but few are helpful to anyone in the real world (or outside the newspaper business). Nausea sets in after the second chapter. Neuharth will die an old, lonely, rich man. Respected by many, hated by nearly all. Luckily, I didn't have to sit through this entire book. I put it down quickly.",79
0,disappointing and disturbing,"I had high expectations from a love story which looked complicated on paper, but honestly I found it disturbing and a bit disappointing. The characters of Sam, Tessa and Allie are written well but the love triangle seems to be stuck in the past for ever and then it is suddenly resolved out of nowhere. It seemed the classic approach of appreciating something more when you are about to lose it. I still fail to understand the marriage and how it worked so long with this major baggage. I guess I just did not like it. The ridiculous way to add a third romantic interest so that everyone is happy is a bit of a letdown too.",117

1,"Sexual climaxs were great, but the ending climax was a dud","This is the first Devine book I've read. I've heard that her stories are comparable to Robin Schoen in eroticism and suspense. The sex was very plentiful and steamy. The characters of Diandra and Justin were well conceived and developed. The plot, altough a bit contrived, was suspenseful and kept my attention, but the ending was hurried. Ms. Devine spent over 270 pages developing the story to have the mystery unraveled in under 10 pages. Also, the fact that Justin and Diandra would find love in the mist of such contention and mistrust is unbelievable. Despite the quick and unsatisfying ending, I recommend the book. Ms. Devine's sexual imagery is outstanding and the story was capitivating. If your looking for a book that will leave you dreaming for some bridal cream this is it.",134
1,great animation movie - poetic sci-fi,"The original manga from Masamune Shiro was somewhat a great experience. But instead of just trying to render the manga to the screen, Mamoru Oshi (patlabor 1&2, Jinro...) created a real piece of art! Both the design, story, rythm, animation, drawing and music are absolutly astounding! This is not just a sci-fi movie. It avoids all the ""clichés"" and is more poetic than violent. If I had to keep only one movie, this will be the one.",77
1,Sony ICF-C318,Clock arrived when Amazon said which is typical. Very happy with Amazon shipping. For about $15 this is a great product. Easy to setup. When you turn it on it has the correct time already. Just change the time zone and you're ready. The display is easy to see in daylight or nighttime. There are two alarms and both are extremely easy to set up. Radio works great for its price and alarm is great also. My only complaint was the internal battery had to be replaced after 5 days and no power outages. The replacement battery at WalMart was about $2. Hope the new one lasts longer. I would highly recommend this clock radio.,115
0,Want to really hose your machine?,"This has got to be the biggest waste of disk ever. I've used different sorts of operating systems, from OS/2, WIN 3.1, WIN95, WIN98 and Windows NT. Thankfully I didn't shell out any cash for this junk - it came prepacked with my HP Pavilion. It locks up the machine at the blink of an eye. Printing with my Canon Multipass has ceased. The help function is a joke - it needs help itself - it fails to initialize and displays a charming number to notify MS suppport with. The real kicker is that the help automatically pops up if there is a cancelled function or error in some other application that you simply backed out of. So, the helpless help comes up and locks the machine. If you want to spend lots of time rebooting the machine - go ahead and buy this. At least this OS boots real fast...I'm replacing it with Windows 2000 Pro.",157

1,Not as creepy as people say but a good book,"When plain Jane Goodwin is asked to become one of the Bitches (school royalty) she can't refuse.She will finally be popular.Not the regular kind of popular but so popular that no one can help but worship her.All she has to do is every week steal somthing from another girl and place it on the desk of Lurl the Pearl the creepy early religon teacher.Sounds simple right ""For one to rise another must fall?"". Not.Because a tiny part of Jane's brain is telling her this is wrong.But the bigger part of her brain is making up excuses for her and the other Bitches' behavior.But when Bitsy (the junior Bitch) tries to harm another girl named Camilla Jane stops making excuses and tries to help Camilla who's not as innocent as she seems.This is a good book that will make you look at the popular girls at your school and think ""Are they really that ruthless?""",154

0,Never received!!,I bought this book for my daughter for a college class on the 28th of August and paid the extra money for it to be expedited so she would have it in time for her first assignments. We never received the book and had to withdraw her from her class because she got so far behind in the week we waited. My credit card was charged for both the fee for the book as well as the expedite fee. It's really hard to find any one to talk to.

Actually, a lot of this stuff I kind of knew but until I got into ""Windows XP for Dummies;9 Books in 1"", I did not know how to unlock? This is the logical book to answer all your questions and unlock the logic of XP.

0,Don't waste the extra money,"We have been going through quality can opener nightmare lately, every single can opener I buy is junk.

But then I thought I am so over it, I am going to splurge for top of the line. I was very excited about ending the nightmare. About 2-3 weeks later, just stopped working, you could fight with it sometimes and manage to finish opening the can you have partially open, but most the time I had to pull the Dollar Tree one out and struggle through that to get my can open. I am very disappointed in oxo. I have always trusted their products without doubt, now I will look on with doubt on them as well.

0,It was free and it still wasn't worth it,"I picked up this product at a swap meet. It was still in the packaging and hadn't been opened. I'm only rating its use as an ""attention getting"" device--the stopwatch and the alarm clock may work fine, but if you need a stopwatch or an alarm clock you should buy a stopwatch or an alarm clock.As for this, I couldn't get it to record. The pre-recorded sounds (Tarzan yell, rooster, etc) are just garbled gibberish that all basically sound the same.

0,More about religion than murder,"First let me say that for once the Kindle formatting wasn't horrible. A few glitches, but not bad.The story itself seemed to be more about why God would let some things happen than what actually DID happen. As a murder story it didn't entirely hold together, which saddened me because I think she had a good idea and some good characters, but they got over shadowed with the heavy handed God stuff. Not being a religious person it grated really bad for me and I found I skimmed a lot of things. I managed to make it thru this book, but went ahead and deleted the second off my Kindle.

I even went back a couple of pages on my Kindle thinking I hit the forward button by mistake. Here in what I would have thought was the middle of the book are all these character discriptions and some of the characters were not even in the book. Any series I have ever read had a beginning, middle and an end. The books could have stood alone, but made me want to continue reading the series to see how the story and the characters evolve. I felt with this book I really was missing part of the book. I doubt I'll finish this series unless the rest of the books are offered for free or the 99 cent special. The only way I'd pay more is if the second one is free and I feel the books are actually going somewhere.",176

1,A billion year future history,"Poul Anderson, one of our great science fiction writers, takes us on a journey of a billion years with this yarn. It begins with astronaut Christian Brannock in the near term future and ends about a billion years later, with humanity scattered across the galaxy and for the most part uploaded into the computers that span the galaxy and control everything. A few humans have been re-instated on earth for an experiment run by a perhaps slightly deranged computer called Gaia.This novel did keep my interest, although it may be too far 'off the wall' for some tastes.",98
1,He who is without sin!,"“Casting the First Stone” by Kimberla Lawson Roby is a masterful presentation of creative writing. Ms. Roby is very inventive and uses great imagination in portraying the characters and situations of her story. In this novel, she vividly described the fraught lives of a married couple who struggles to remain faithful to each other in their Christian walk. Tanya, who is presupposed to have achieved a degree of life success, is married to Curtis, a charismatic pastoral husband who is laden with some obvious spiritual weaknesses. As their marriage suffered, Tanya’s serene and beautiful love of life began to turn sour and her affection for the things she once admired began to grow cold. And like a woman who was abducted for marriage falls in love with her abductor, she learns of her husband’s infidelity and succumbs to the same weaknesses that plagued his life. It is an interesting read.",150

0,Too disorganized for beginners; too basic for everyone else,"I really doubt anyone could learn Transact-SQL in 21 days using this book. On the contrary, you could spend 21 months with this one and still not get there. It's disorganized and free-styled to a fault. The topics are all over the place. Also the writing is inconsistent. One minute, it's at 30,000 feet, the next minute, it's on the runway. One minute, the author is talking down to you, the next minute, he's attempting to be your buddy. If you're looking for a quick, systematic introduction to Transact-SQL, keep looking.",91
1,One of my best and most used books,"I play many styles of music, but Jazz is my favorite, as the chords are the warmest of them all.You don't need to pound on the guitar, do a bunch of bends, play the same two notes to monotony, or have any accompaniment to sound full bodied and just right all by yourself. Blues does this to a point, but just does not use the full bodied chords that Jazz does.Jazz chords are not necessarily easy, but well worth it once you have them down.The book goes through the types of chord forms until around page 31 and then you are off with the actual progressions.I am an old Wes Montgomery fan and can remember many good times with his music and now I can actually play someof it.",129

1,"Dreamy, more original, less corny","Front Line Assembly's side-project Delerium is sounding more dreamy and original than ""Symantic Spaces"". Less corny, a little less of the embarrassing Enigma beats and choirs, much more Mid-Eastern chanting and soundscapes, and stunning female vocals. Favourites: ""Silence"", ""Window To Your Soul"", ""'Til The End Of Time"". Try and get the double CD version which includes some interesting remixes from this album and ""Symantic Spaces"".To FLA fans who don't know Delerium, these two bands have nothing in common - this, the later Delerium work is pseudo-commercial ethereal (earlier work can be described as ambient), compared to FLA's industrial signature.",99
1,Lots of Interesting Twists and Turns,"I was not immediately taken with the book, however, as the characters developed I caught on to MB's style. She is constantly weaving in and out of situations and characters. Finally, you see all of it forming a amazing tapestry.

1,"Very Good, but not Perfect","I bought this rice cooker a month ago and we used it almost every day. We used it to cook white rice most of the time. I have tried brown rice once and sponge cake twice.White Rice: Taste and texture-wise, it's the same as my other rice cookers. But it takes 45min to cook (vs 20min in others). There is a Quick Cook feature, but that is 30min still. There is 1 noticeable difference with the rice, it tastes very good the next day with microwave reheating.Brown Rice: Texture-wise, there is a huge difference from my other rice cookers. The brown rice is soft and plum, but it takes almost 2hr to cook.Sponge Cake: The cakes collapsed both times after I opened the lid.Features I like:- Retractable power cord- Non-stick coating bowl- Music indicator of when it starts and ends- ""Bumpy"" spatula and spatula holder on the sideFeatures I don't like:- No condensation collector- Having to clean inner lid every time",161

It was a delight -- lots of chuckles, with enough serious subject matter to keep it from being a dramatized version of the Shopping Channel. Deborah Messing is perfect as the ""starter wife"" who's dumped by her studio honcho husband and thinks her life is over. Not so -- a new life is just beginning. Messing and her small coterie of loyal friends are great, and the hunk she finds on the beach is a feast for the eyes. The miniseries is great fun, guaranteed to bring a smile.",106

I wasn't sure i'd like the show but i'd heard about the movie so i decided to give the show a try. I really enjoyed it. I think those zombie things are freaky but they never really show much gore. I like all the characters each is very different. I thought the westerness of it was a nice suprise. I liked the people more in the show than in the movie because i got to know them more.I wish they could continue the show right where they left off.

1,Another gem by NOVA,"Although there has been some films mentioning about UAV's (unmanned aerial vehicles), this one has the best coverage so far. The motivation dates back to U-2 flying over the Soviet sky. From the Cold War, Mid East conflicts, Vietnam War, Gulf War and Afghanistan, the experience leads to the evolution of UAV's and makes them more and more powerful and robust.Unlike the large-scale UAV's such as the Predator and Global Hawk, small-scale or even micro-scale UAV's also found their importance and are being developed. This is also an interesting part in this film.The content of this DVD is pretty thorough and comprehensive. After having watched it, I just feel it completely delightful and entertaining. Although I've already had certain understanding about UAV's, it is still an eye-opener for me.I have seen couple tech-related films by NOVA and found them well made. This one is no exception. For people who like military aircraft, this is the one you never should miss.",160

One story is somewhat serious and complex, but has a wry/somewhat comical story line mixed in the the dramatic role of Alan Alda and Jane Fonda. The other 3 stories are simply hilarious. I mean, when you mix Bill Cosby, Richard Prior, Walter Matthau, Michael Caine.....with this kind of an cast, you can't loose! It is good fun with a 70s kind of comic fun!

When we opened the gift it looked so neat, I could see the attraction, but I agree with all of those who have talked about the small black-and-white display with very poor resolution. The games are not nearly as good as those on the Leapster and the laptop is pretty large to take places. After a few minutes playing on his laptop, he always asks to play on my laptop. If anything, it has increased his desire to use my computer, and this is not good.We have a VTECH digital camera that is great - I'm surprised by how poor the graphics are on the Nitro Laptop. Even at that low price, the technology is at a point where they should be able to offer something better.",172

What I got was one of the worst games money could buy that basically, in my opinion, made fun of d&d. And the magic missiles... I missed a lot with them in this game...in d&d they can't miss. Period. This game was awful... I miss games that had a plot",126

It is ludicrous to attack Brock, as some have, for being unbelievable now since he has admitted to lying in the past. Blinded by the Right reads like the truth, a truth Brock has no credible reason for coloring. Independent thinkers who are not affiliated with movements or political parties should find the facts in the book highly illuminating and if they are serious about casting responsible votes, they will take a long hard look at the ""brain trust"" in the current administration and the forces and events that allowed that ""trust"" and its agenda to be placed in control of the free world.",138

0,2nd worst textbook I have ever encountered!,"This introductory text is strictly written for those who already possess a strong background in the field. The writing is poor (even for an engineering text), concepts are not fully expanded upon, formulas and general ""look-up"" concepts are nearly nonexistant, examples (which are few) cover only very general cases, and corresponding problems are disproportionally difficult. In many cases, examples are not worked, but instead contain the phrase, ""It is left as an exercise for the reader to complete this example."" As an analogy, imagine an example describing addition with the phrase, ""It is left as an exercise for the reader to derive integration."" A text must have the potential to be used as reference material, but because of the lack of concrete information and worked examples, this book has been robbed of that potential.",134

There's only about three good songs. Xzibit's aggressiveness and lyrical prowess is nowhere to be found, the beats are too commercialized and poppy sounding...it just makes me want to throw up.

The last 10 pages or so are filled with his haiku in English, which are not outstanding. I am baffled by the title, since haiku seemingly has very little to do with Mr Norimoto's life.",93

A smart, funny and wry look at life. Mark Haddon is one of those wonderful writers who creates characters who you hate to say goodbye to when the book ends.",89
1,"Highly readable, very informative","This is probably my favorite book on U.S. social history. While academic, it's written in a very readable style. The authors make the history of American families extremely interesting, and they shatter some of our more romantic cultural myths. I referred to this book when I wrote my master's thesis on the U.S. household economy of the 1930s during the Great Depression. My first ancestors in this country lived in New England in the early to mid 1600s, so I find these accounts fascinating, as I can imagine how all of my ancestors since that time lived their lives in our developing country and culture.

0,Popeye takes a beating,"A warning to Popeye fans: The ""75th Anniversary"" reference is deceptive, leading one to believe that this 3-disc set contains some of the delightfully bizarre Max Fleischer efforts of the 1930s or the tamer but still entertaining Famous Studios entries of the 1940s. But no, this ""Collector's Edition"" is comprised of 86 of the lame King Features Syndicate knockoffs from 1960-61. These hastily-produced, barely-animated, made-for-TV cheapies do an injustice to the Popeye legend. Under ideal circumstances, the spinach-gulping sailor man was showcased in some of the best cartoons ever made. Here, unfortunately, his reputation takes the kind of severe beating Jim Caviezel suffered in THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. Lord have mercy!",112

The former even pauses pretty often, which is a fine thing to do if there's, you know, MUSIC the rest of the time. It's just a lot of foreplay without getting to the deed, you know? You're basically waiting for the song to start the whole time and it just never does.The rest of the tracks are just a loose, lazy, bubblegum pop that I really don't care for.",119

Badly written, directed, and acted, its only value is to remind you how good the classics of the mob genre are in comparison. The final shootout, which someone here raves over, is especially hilarious. The gunmen who whack the wedge cut-wearing guido ""hero"" really are the gang that couldn't shoot straight. It's fun to check out the 70s hairdos (Frank Vincent's poodle cut is a hoot) but that's about the only redeeming feature about this C-grade flick.",88
0,They Saved Hitler's DVD,"This is one for bad movie fans. UCLA film student picked up the rights to an unreleased turkey called “Madmen of Mandoras,” added some incompetent, unrelated new footage at the beginning, and released it under the new, more lurid title “They Saved Hitler’s Brain.” The result is the absolute bottom of the barrel of cinema – and a delight for bad movie fans like myself. Night turns to day turns to night during a car chase, the plot suddenly changes around the 20 minute mark, and der fuhrer’s head melts in a fiery car crash.The DVD, released by Rhino, claims to be “remastered from original film elements.” It still looks pretty miserable and sounds absolutely atrocious, but I suppose that should be expected. It’s presented in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, despite being shot at 2.20:1. There are no special features unless you count a list of similarly themes Rhino titles. The menu is absolutely hilarious.",155

The only problem with this record is this: I saw Tim and Faith together at Baltimore Arean in Dec. of 2000 and he played ""Let Me Love You"" at the end of the show, but instead of him being solo, like it is on the record, it was a duet and it sounded better that way.

You'll spend most of the time watching wondering how a movie with pretty big-name actors in it could be so bad. Wahlberg at his worst. The funny thing is: John Liguisamo is an oasis of good acting, which contrasts and UNDERSCORES how the sub-par performance by the others.

Abbey Lee Miller is just a big woman with a large mouth that just angles for a fight. The moms are self-absorbed and clearly are in this for the attention and seem to care more about exposure than their own children. To say you watch this as a guilty pleasure is an affront to humanity because there is nothing of merit on this show. Children get exploited for the adults' pleasure and to say you enjoy this means you truly are not looking at the greater picture. The kind of world these young girls are thrust into is a horrible one and I would be calling a social worker to have most of these girls removed from their parents.

Not much happens until the very end of the book. I have been a fan of Ms Hamilton for many years, but her writing over the past few years has too much sex and not enough plot.

This one had the outside temperature in addition to the time. I did have a little issue getting it on daylight savings time, but after that it seemed to work very well. The temperature seemed to take a while to stabilize, and it does seem to measure to the high side, but all-in-all, it works extremely well. The projection size of the digits are a little smaller but more precise than the Oregon Scientific but what a great device that allows you to see the time and temperature without twisting and squinting. I took a fall a few years back and am in a wheelchair making this a near necessity, especially on vacation. I would recommend these clocks to everyone.",146

You probably don't have to watch all the past episodes to enjoy the show, but I would recommend it. They build the characters nicely - you love some and hate others. Also, besides the idea that the Earl and his family are very benevolent people (most wealthy folks of this era were not), the show seems to recreate the model and image of the classes in early 20th century England with historic accuracy.",129

The DRM is frustrating for exactly ONE of the pirates, and for ALL the rest of the legitimate customers. The only people it doesn't bother are ALL of the pirates, and the few customers that don't realize how much simpler and faster the pirated version is.I feel like the people who add DRM to their games are saying ""The beatings will continue until morale improves.""

This is the first cd I have ever had that I dance around to during the day but can fall asleep at nite to the same beats. This cd offers spunk and serentity.",114
0,Good Drive - but misses backing up key files!!!,"Install went OK. Drive runs OK. Backup backs up My Documents. However, I use FireFox and ThunderBird. All my favorites, bookmarks, e-mail and address books are in C:\Documents and Settings\Owner\Application Data\Mozilla and Thunderbird. I have chosen these subdirectories to be backed up many times, but Maxtor will not remember these settings. It wipes them all out except for My Documents. So if you want it backed up, be sure it is in My Documents.This is a real violation of trust. I probably should have given it zero stars, but it does seem to work on My Documents.",97
0,For Jarheads,"I too wasn't very impressed with Jarhead. I thought half way through that Jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the Marines, and perhaps other branches of the military. For those of us who haven't I just don't think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested. As someone else mentione. I too thought it was going to be a more modern version of Full Metal Jacket, but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn't...",86
0,Awful,"What a load of garbage. First of all getting though the boring yuck of his life story is just stupid. Then the story, parts aren't half bad. Getting interrupted by his italics was maddening. This book was not worth my money,time or effort. Save yourself!",45
0,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I expected a wonderfully illustrated book with great photography, but was very disappointed when the book arrived. Not only was it dull, the paper quality was poor. The amateurish illustrations were a joke. This is really not something to buy if you want some sort of visual reminder of the Towers or to commerate the horrific events on September 11.",60
1,Excellent!,I could barely put this book down! David Anthony Durham captures the passion and romance of ancient warfare/culture in a very powerful novel. The historical content is very accurate while also telling of fictional drama in hannibal's life. I would recomend this book to anybody who loves reading ancient history.,50
0,These tapes must be old,"I bought this tape for someone and they reported to me that it played back all funny sounding, like the tape was stretching. I cannot comment about the music itself as the tape was not for me. I am not much of a music critic anyway, but the tapes must have been made a long time ago on low quality tapes since playback is junk.I would look for it on CD or some other format that will survive time better.",80

0,A little on the cheap side,"I like this pill planner mainly for it's shape. It's small enough that I can just stick it in my purse. Unfortunately, it's kind of cheaply made. When you lift one of the tabs, it will only open up a little bit for you. You can't force it open any further because the tab will just break off, which is what happened to me. The plastic ""hinge"" of the tab is just a stiff piece of plastic. It is not very pliable. So you can either slip in your pills through the little opening you can get, or try to open it further and risk breaking the tab right off. I would have otherwise been happy with the product.",119
1,Best thing I have ever read. Could not put it down.,"I have been reading romance for the past 12 years (everything from Barbara Cartland to Jackie Collins).

0,Cooked Rival Customer,"I purchased two of the 20 quart Rival cookers, one for myself and one for other family members in the Fall of 2002. It appears both units suffered a failure when cooking- they simply stoppped heating in less than 12 months after the purchase.Upon contacting Rival they offered to repair the units at $20.00 plus any shipping costs we would incur to get it there. This was hardly worth the time or money. The reason I write this review is to alert other consumers that this unit appears to be junk, though it worked well prior to the failure. Each product failed within a year of purchase... ironically within the same family. Sure, that's less than a scientific sampling- but its plenty of data for me.I totally agree with the concept of using such a device but would highly recommend consumers look for better quality. I regret my price driven purchase.",151

0,Avoid at all costs,"I was drawn to this unit because it plays everything (including both DVD-audio and SACD formats) and is a five disc changer. Unfortunately, the unit is very slow to respond to commands, especially loading the discs and opening the tray. Moreover, the tray doesn't rotate or come out all the way, so it is very difficult to access the back two discs. More importantly, two units have failed on me (stopped responding to commands altogether) after a couple of weeks. I have had to send both units back to the distributor full of CDs/DVDs. This is a piece of junk!",100
1,Kinda fun for the owner too!,"Wish it held a charge a little longer, but still a great little toy. Kinda fun for me too. Cat goes nuts with this little toy.

Can't wait to get off work and go play with this a bit more... maybe I'll let the cat play with it too!",69
1,Buy it for the sayings of the Ammas,"The sayings of the desert mothers (the Ammas) are worth the purchase of the book. They are starkly beautiful and fresh. However, Laura Swan's commentary is predictable, dull and full of religious jargon and psychological cliche. Often the commentary loses sight of a particular Amma's ""saying"" entirely. Swan has a knack for missing the humor or irony in many of the sayings. I soon gave up reading Swan and simply read the Ammas' sayings -- and was more than rewarded.",80
0,Sorry I Bought This One,"Live and learn I guess. Don't get me wrong, this unit is powerful and the electric ran smooth. But there is no reason this thing should be so loud. I have to put plywood in front of it to deflect the sound. Tecumseh could have put a better and bigger muffler on this engine. They tested this motor when they made it, so they didn't realize it was so loud. Or did they decide to save a few bucks by installing an undersized ineffective muffler? As a builder, I start early and have many complaints from neighbors calling village halls about the noise. I even tried calling Tecumseh to see if this thing could be modified to make it quieter. Plus there is no excuse for the cheap plastic oil stick that come with this. The plummer I use has a Coleman Powermate with the same 10 hp Tecumseh motor with the cheap plastic oil stick. Same noise problem. So I can't blame Porter Cable other than their poor choice of using the Tecusmeh engine in this generator.",178
0,Otherwise Good Cover Ruined by Design Flaw,"I liked this cover until I brought my Nook on vacation, and had two occasions when the Nook fell out of the case. This happens because while two of the corners are held in with elastic straps, the other two straps are fashioned with strips of cloth that are sown in the shape of a pocket, and both of them quickly became loose with wear. Based on that problem, I cannot recommend this product.",74
0,A very poor DVD,"Video quality is so bad ( no star )that you wonder why they put it on DVD? Story is not much better. If you like tabloid type of gossip,it may be for you. ""AFI's 100 years 100 movies"" is a much better choice.",43
1,The excavation of a Neutral cemetery,"This is the archeological report published by the Royal Ontario Museum of the excavation of Neutral cemetery dating from c. 1640-1650 that was conducted at Grimsby, Ontario, Canada from October 1976 to April 1977. In total, 55 graves were discovered, from which the remains of 367 individuals were removed. The book deals with each grave individually, although in most cases the description consists of little than a short paragraph. Included are a number of figures and plates. All in all, the report gives one interesting insight into the lives and customs of the Neutral Indians, and a better understanding of pre-European occupancy of southwestern Ontario.",105

0,overpriced piece of junk,I cannot believe I paid eighty dollars for this worthless item! I really wanted to get one quickly and it was the only one I could find in BabysrUs. There are much better mats online for a fraction of cost! The interlocking mechanism does not work at all! I don't know how they came up with this idea-the pieces stop fitting together very quickly and my baby is now ignoring all his toys in favor of pulling this mat apart and putting it in his mouth which is unhygienic. Even my cats destroy the structure by getting underneath. Because of multiple small pieces you cannot move it around easily. There are many gaps in between and the squares loose thier luster after a week. I am getting a new one and will only keep a few squares for my cats to scratch-honestly thats all this mat is good for. Extremely dissappointed given high price.,154

0,Greatly Surprised (UPDATE),"We had been looking for a patio ""sectional"" and were on the verge of paying much, much more. When the furniture arrived (in its 70# boxes), there were a few dings in a couple of pieces. I wasn't excited about shipping back the heavy freight, so I took some pictures and called Amazon. We made a deal we could both live with. The new furniture looks WONDERFUL. I would have preferred more cushion color choices, but we Scotch Guarded the light color and we'll see how it goes. VERY, VERY happy.UPDATE: When the price went way down, we ordered 2 more pieces to make the ""sectional"" larger. These pieces again arrived with slight damage, but that was far from the worst thing. The pieces are actually completely different. They are not built nearly as sturdy, the legs are a 1/2"" shorter and smaller in diameter. The cushions are completely different. I am still happy with the old pieces, but the new ones are horrible!! I would not buy these pieces now if I were you!!!",175

0,Having diffirent beliefs than republicans is treason.,"Oh my.The problem with Ann Coulter, is that her entire argument is that The Pledge of Alliance + The Flag + Strong National Defense = Patriotic, and that only by these standards can patriotism be judged. Appearantly, liberals ""hate the flag"" and are therefore are ""commiting treason"". And that liberals are constantly working against our country (I can only assume that by ""our country"" she means conservative ideology).She guages being patriotic as ""writing a patriotic song"" and ""serving in world war 2"". I doubt she's done either. (Though she does have an idea for such a song ""Good-bye Walla Walla I'm off to Smash Allah"") so being a patriot is promoting hate for the religion of others. If only I had known.So everybody, lets bust out our American flags, tanks, and hate for Islam, least we be call considered treasonists.",140

1,Dangerously In Love,"I remember this album when I was 16. This album is very diverse and the music is groovy and soulful. The musical influences from hip-hop to rock to jazz. The album is equally divided between seductive mid-tempos,lush ballads and fiery club bangers, providing a sharp focus on who Beyonce is right now as a performer,woman and as a creative force. This album is the sound of a grown woman clearly staking her claim in the world and redefining expectations of who she is. The vibe is more mature,more playful,more deeply passionate and sexually aggressive. This album has been certified 4x Platinum. Remember,this was 2003-2004.",104

There are also pockets that I can put my mP3 and cell phone in. The only problem I have is that it can be a little bit cumbersome if carrying it in a crowded area and can be uncomfortable on the shoulders if you have to carry it for a long period of time.

This is a James Bond movie with cartoon cars in place of actors. My 3 year old son was so excited to see this movie. Mater's Tall Tales is better than this movie.",81

The worms didn't arrive till the following Thursday. When I opened the package, the worms didn't look very lively and it looked like there were maybe 100 worms in the bag... nowhere near the 1000 worms claimed by the description.

They both enjoy driving, and being passangers. Charge initially for at least 18 hrs and never over charger for more than 30 hrs. Mine came with the battery and charger. Look before purchasing a play vehicle for your kids if the charger and battery come or are purcahsed seperately batteries are around 55.00, and chargers are about 25. This definetly increases the initial purchase price. Shipping was on time and assembly was not to difficult. Be sure to charge vehicle before showing the kids though....

Good book for someone who has either experienced depression or needs to gain greater insight into the nature of depression. However, the title is somewhat inaccurate considering that Prozac is not even discussed until the last few chapters--so if the reader is looking for a book about Prozac/or an individual accounting of the effects of Prozac try another book.

Also the mouse works great on various surfaces and fits perfectly in my hand. It's clicking is a little louder than I would prefer, but completely tolerable. The only con, is that upon trying to install the drivers on my new laptop, is that the software is not compatible with Windows 7. However, the mouse is still functional, including the general scrolling of the wheel (up, down, left, right) but has lost the functionality of the side button. Still plan on continuing use with this mouse.",140

0,Dear Walt Disney! Do you think we're fools???,"First of all: I LOVE this movie!!! I give it five stars and more! But what is your problem with selling a perfect DVD to make your buyers happy? I saw the movie years ago in Germany in the original format and language. The beautiful Song: ""When love is gone"" was in that movie and the whole film was obviously in Widescreen format! So... what is your problem to release the DVD with these features. Do you want to make even more money, by saying in a couple of years: ""Sorry, we made a mistake. But here's a new DVD with all of the features for ONLY xx.xx$?I'd recommend to all of the fans: ""DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!"" Don't play into the hands of these big corporations!!!",127

0,Awful telescope,"This is one of the worst telescopes i ever owned.The instructions are extremely confusing, and the mount shakes in the smallest breeze.

0,Do not waste your money,"When I purchased this book I was hoping to receive a manual discussing ""Home Automation and Wiring"" instead I received a mish mash of very low tech information.

I would strongly recommend purchasing ""Structured Wiring and Design Manual"" by Robert N. Bucceri.",68

0,"A ""bit"" dangerous","I couldn't wait to finally be able to use this expensive bit that has sat in my Raised Panel kit for years now. I followed all the rules. I purchased a high end router table and installed a 2 1/2HP variable speed router as recommended. It took about 12 passes to safely accomplish a single profile on one edge of a 10"" piece of poplar. Even with the smallest adjustments, there were still some break out and kick-back. I'll go back to my nice safe vertical raised panel bit. This bit looks great, very large, and it will end up being a very expensive display piece in my router bit collection. Stick to the vertical bits. I was very disappointed in this one, and it's definitely not worth the money.",130

0,Umm...TRICK TRAINER - I get it now,If you are buying this dog because you were looking for a moving - walking talking type toy - you are sadly mistaken. The decription for this toy is HIGLY misleading. It does not do any tricks and you can't train it. I was thinking like maybe a furby type action would be taking place. Instead when I got it - It is a stuffed animal with magnets in its paws and nose. So you can make the toy move with the magnets but it does not really do anything like it claims to. The TRICK was they got you to spend 25 dollars for it - thinking it was going to be trainable like the nindendogs game is. I would recommend that the company pursue making an actual working dog along these lines. Rather than what I got from them.,141

I followed the book to the tee. I even tested and made sure the oven was the perfect temperature, and used a scooper that makes perfect tablespoon sized balls. and all I got was flat ugly cookies. I made a second batch immediately afterwards thinking I might of overmixed. Same results!I suspecting the amount of butter is the cause of the flat cookies.

He put all of himself out there for us on this one, and the album as a whole reminds me of the writing in Every Night, from Anthem. for those moaning that it is not fast enough, go back and listen to Boogada again.......i'll listen to Emo.",117
0,HEY - why can't we have ZERO stars ?,"HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! I received this camera as gift a little over 2 years ago. It went belly up AGAIN - shows the Camera Error #E45 like the other guy said. It had done it once before where the lense got stuck and I couldn't take any more pictures nor could I shut the stupid thing down. So the junk went back to kodak and they stated that the issue was the on/off switch. They indicated that the on/off switch was causing the problems because it would turn on while it was in the bag (or purse) and thus, ruin the lense ??? ANYWAY ... the switch was replaced so you had to push a button in order to turn on the stupid thing. Well it broke AGAIN! Now this is only several months after they supposedly ""fixed"" it ... unless my purse figured out how to push the button .... hmmm .... VERY VERY VERY poor quality!

0,Snooze Wood,"I came into this movie expecting something other than what was delivered and I suspect that this may have impacted my overall enjoyment of the movie. From the very beginning Wake Wood has a truncated quality to it which makes it difficult for the viewer to connect with the poorly realized characters and their situation -- almost as if the film makers felt that the initial tragedy would be sufficient to buy the viewers interest and sympathy for the whole of the movie.Wake Wood inhabits an uneasy space between a mystery, occult thriller, and slasher film and manages to fail on all three counts though if it had simply focused on the occult thriller aspect there were a number of intriguing ideas that were barely explored and seemed to exist as window dressing though they were by far the most interesting aspects of the film.",145
0,Manual tuning disappoints,"I expected more for a $50.00 radio from Sony. It's difficult to find radio stations, because there's no scanning or automatic tuning. (Two months ago I bought a no-name radio for two dollars and fifty cents that had automatic tuning - I just assumed Sony would offer this feature.) Reception is only OK. Also, the manual tuning is limited. You can only change the frequency by 1/10 (from 98.7 to 98.8). Often, the best reception would be in between (let's say, 98.75) and you can't get the best reception. Cool design. Like the mega bass. But a radio for jogging without automatic tuning/scanning is a bad investment. Don't buy it.",110

0,not comprehensive,"I found this guide barely scratches the surface of travel possibilities in Botswana, offering few choices within each price range, and scant historical or cultural information. If you plan to visit only northern Botswana or the Central Kgalagadi (as most tourists so) then better to purchase the Bradt guide, which even after 2 years in Botswana, I still find interesting. The sight seeing and accomodation information in Lonely PLanet guide is meager at best, offering few choices. In Botswana, the best and most interesting places are off the beaten path, and Lonely Planet did not bother to find many of them for their readers. If you plan on visting southern or eastern Botswana (near Gaborone or Selebi-Phikwe) then buy a guide that includes South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia as well. This guide was fairly useless to me and has hardly left my bookshelf in the 2 years I've been in Bots! For a truly enjoyable holiday, buy a different guide.",160

I am intrigued by the child that was interoduced as I don't often seen those issues addressed in historical mysteries. One quibble, I'm tiring of the plot line that this book takes. For whatever reason, it's become commonplace in period mysteries. You don't need to shock me to maintain my interest.

0,in the arcade you can spend as many quarters as you like,"HOD2 lives up to its billing as a fast action shooter. It does so, however, by ignoring everything else that a game should offer. Other reviews understate the necessity of the laser gun. The aimer simply moves to slowly to allow for any reasonable chance of success. There is no free will, or choice in this game. The only way gameplay affects storyline is to open doors that lead to diversions from the VERY scripted plot. The acting is a complete joke, leaving this reviewer wondering what was lost in the translation. Most disappointing, however, is the notion of credits. You cannot extend play for longer than nine credits, great in the true-to-the-arcade-game translation except that in the arcade no-one is going to limit you to nine plays. This creates a hopeless expectation of perfection to actually finish the game and dooms players to playing the first screens over and over again. not much fun.",155

Trunks, Goten and Android 18 team up to fight the resurrected Broly. He's finally defeated. That's about it. This movie is honestly a waste.

0,Horrible film.,"I tried to bring myself to like it, but I can't. With Sean Connery in the cast, I expected a lot out of this film, but it's got a bad script and the direction seemed more tailormade for special effects rather than the acting. The humor in it sucks (example: Tom Sawyer is ""checking out"" the vampiress, and Allan says ""She's out of your league."" League! As in League of Extroadinary Gentlemen!"" HA. Not funny.). In fact, at the theater, PEOPLE WERE LAUGHING AT THESE DUMB JOKES. As I said, the direction is horrid, which is even worse since it's the director of ""Blade"" (Stephen Norrington), and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Bland acting, average special effects, horrible script, heavyhanded direction, and ludicrous plot devices (how is a domino effect stopped by the destruction of ONE building??) all add up to one stupid film. Watch other comic book films instead. You might negatively vote, but chances are, you are out of MY league. And my league is ultimate.",167

Personally, I agree with the current Geological Thought on this matter - which is that pole shifts do occur and that they have occurred in the past. Where I disagree with the current historical philosphy is that the pole shifts do not alter regional climate and thus impact civilizations. That is where this book comes in. It makes a long standing and firm argument for periodic catastrophic events. The book documents the points and theories in an enjoyable manner and is a quick and easy read. This is a MUST READ book for anyone interested in the mysteries of ancient civilizations and geologic processes. I rate this book most highly.",125
0,Simple to the point of no learning,"At first it is appealing because of its simplist approach, but upon further reading it becomes apparent that this book tries to simplify the material to the extreme.

It doesn't care if you understand the principles and doesn't give you the information to understand the concepts -- just tries to give you simple examples for you to memorize. I take offense as this approach suggests sonographers are too slow to learn anything more than silly diagrams and memorization tricks.",95
0,Waste of time.,"A lot of reviewers who like this movie tell people who didn't like the movie to read the book. Why read the book when we are trying to watch a good movie? Let's be honest here. The movie has a lot of fans but it is a bad movie to an average person who is happy with life. I watched it thinking it is a modern classic or something, but what a disappointment. Don't watch the movie unless you have nothing to do.",83
1,Way to go Disney!,This movie was awesome! I think it is very close to how Robert Louis Stevenson would have done it if he had done it in the future. Morf was hilarious! I loved the scene where Jim was solar surfing - VERY cool.,42
1,Well made Flag Bracket,This is actually a Bronze Flag bracket with a nice Nickle plate over it. I would buy it again. The only problem I found was that the three holes to attach it are kinda close together under the bracket. It would have been a better idea to put two hole underneath and then one attach point above the bracket to help distribute the weight over a bigger surface.,68

1,Remarkable story,"I read this book many years ago when it first was published. The thing that really stood out to me was that my husband was born just about a week later than Sergei Kourdakov and I kept thinking how different our lives were here at the same time Sergei was living in Russia. The girl, Natasha, that was beaten so much and then would be at the next meeting when Sergei would raid it was so brave. I kept thinking that she probably didn't realize what an impact her life had on this man and will only know the extent of her faith and how she was the reason for Sergei to come to know Jesus when she finally reaches her heavenly reward..what a courageous lady she was! This book is one that I have read over and over and recommend it to everyone!",144

It's extremely rewarding.My 2 biggest tips:1. DO NOT buy your spices at an American grocer, go to international markets. Price and quality are far superior2. If you are not used to extremely hot food, or have heartburn, just cut the chillies out of the recipes or moderate them.",101

1,Amores Perros,"Bleak and brutal, Iñárritu's ""Perros""--literally, ""Love's a bitch""--takes Tarantino up a notch with a story of crime, betrayal, and abuse set in the rough-and-tumble slums and posh, sanitized condos of Mexico City. Filmed in grainy light to accentuate the hard edges of the story's interconnected plots, ""Perros"" is at once jolting and unsettling, opening with a tour-de-force car chase that not only rivals ""The French Connection,"" but sets in place the tone and sense of desperation embodied in the film's other theme: the anguished nature of love.",87
1,No Man is an Island entire unto himself,"I really enjoyed this book, about a place I will almost certainly never go. It is one of the few in depth meditations on a single place one can find. The other reviewers have said most of what I think needs saying.Two caveats: (1) the archeological material drags the book down eventually. I could have done with about 20 pages less of it. (2) weirdly enough, given that it is a book about a set of isolated islands, and the author's isolation, I eventually wanted to have some more people in the story. That is somewhat unfair as the author does give us a lot of historical figures, but I really wanted to know about the author's wife (we get a picture and a tiny bit about her) and more about the local fisherfolk and all. More conversations, etc.",139

1,HIP HOP ABS,"Bought the used video a month ago - it was listed as 'Very Good'. Other than having to push the volume way up to hear it, and a couple of blips (2-3 second stalls) during the playback, it is well worth the $19.99). Don't like the echo in the background (there is another video playing at the same time and it was annoying at first).The content is excellent. Look forward to it every day and have lost 8 pounds in just under four weeks (also follow South Beach diet so that helped). It is challenging (has modified versions) but Shaun T. leads you through it very well. I use P90X but parts of it are a bit much for me at 66 years old.Oh, I'm a guy and it has 4-5 'eye-candy' ladies and you don't have to watch Shaun T. all the time (there are a couple of guys in it, so you don't feel like you are crashing your wife's cardio class).Definitely worth the $20 -- gonna get Part 2 now.",173
1,Entertaining and Informative,"The book was entertaining and if you are planning to do the Pilgrimage it is informative. I saw the movie ""The Way"" and was curious about the book it was based on. The movie is not a word for word adaptation, but you can see the elements of the book in the story of the movie.As usual the book goes into more depth and more of the feeling the author feels than you would get in the film. The book has a main plot that does not center on a character outside of the author as much as the movie does. But there are characters in both the book and the movie as well as quotations.The book is well done (though a bit wordy) and is a good read even if you have not seen the movie. I enjoyed the book and recommend it, and especially so if you are planning the pilgrimage of Saint James in Spain.",158

0,The read is not worth wait.,"I love the series and the first three books were all excellent. However, in Feast of Crows, Martin's writing is out of control. Rather than offer the cop out that the book grew big enough to be two novels, Feast of Crows should have been edited with the same ruthlessness Martin showed the Starks in the series. This book is encumbered by surplus characters and overburdened by pointless scenes. Paring down the excess would reward faithful readers with a book in the same class as the first three instead half the novel in twice the words.",96
1,Great Rope,"Great rope. I gave it 4 stars as I have not tried every rope out there, but this one is fast and a joy to use. The longer handles with the foam padding are comfortable.

0,Wait... and look for a better book in the market,Please dont get carried away by the wonderful reviews for this book by some readers. This is an expensive book but definitely not worth the money. The book should be named Java I/O programming rather than a network related title.Most of the book deals with Java streams and the network concepts are very few. At some point the book looks like an API reference than a full fledged text. This info is available in Java Docs for free . The font selected for printing the book is a real turn off. Another disaster from Manning .I will suggest reading Java Network programming title form O'Reilly which is due for release in July 2000 ( do not buy the 1997 edition ).,121

We tried even letting a lot of the air out so that it wasn't rolling around so much, and that didn't really work either. Also, once you are out of the chair, you better hope it's not a windy day.

My children love chocolate milk and when I saw this I thought this would be a great item for them. The owner of the company was rude and did not exchange the item.

1,A Beautiful Instrumental Christmas CD,"Tim Janis and his ensemble produce beautiful soft instrumental music--and this cd is no exception. The music's focal point is Tim Janis' piano and keyboards with some soothing strings, flute, and acoustic guitar thrown in for good measure.

This disc is somewhat on the short side (less than 29 mintues long), but does an excellent job putting the listener in the Christmas spirit. A perfect selection for those with multi-disc cd players.

I can still type but I'm going to look into something else a little pricier that will be longer lasting.If you don't type a lot, this probably would not be a problem, but then I would wonder why you would need keyboard replacement stickers to begin with",130

It just failed to show the gradual deterioration of art, in general, and of painting in particular from the time of the Rennaisance to modern times. The entries for modern art were very charitable; the attempt to be sacramental in the descriptions was futile because there was nothing sacramental in most modern art.

0,You better hope you have a good professor...,"because this book is horrible. The examples are almost always useless, the graphs are few and far between and the problems are often above what is actually discussed in the text.

1,An Eclipse Of Hits,"Even though I would have rather Maná to come back with another studio album, they came up with three albums including their greatest hits. ""Sol"" includes the band's ""dancing"" hits, ""Luna"" includes the band's more romantic hits, and ""Eclipse"" includes a combination of both types. This CD includes 13 of the band's past hits and 1 new single ""Te Llevare Al Cielo"". It also includes the video for ""Eres Mi Religion"", which was the second single of their album ""Revolucion De Amor"". One thing that I liked about the booklet in this album is that it gives a backround on some of the songs. This album would have been better if they would have added at least one more song.All in all, this is a very good albums for Maná fans or people who don't have their past albums. I recommend this album.",143
1,Wonder Woman received,On time.....arrived in perfect condition to introduce another generation of wonder women to this fun show !,17
1,Pandora,"I thought Pandora was very well written. Though it may not be as long as most loyal Rice readers are use to it is still worthy to be a part of The Vampire Chronicles. The history that was included in the story, was to give you a better feel of the day to day life of the times; or at least that is what I feel. I would suggest that all Rice fans make sure to read this book.",79
1,Hat with Ear Muffs,I bought this hat for my dad. He wanted one with ear muffs. They are somewhat diffucult to find. He likes this one and I see him wearing it when it is cold. The company shipped the hat very quickly and it arrived before Christmas.,45
1,An unusual travel mystery that will have you hooked,"This is the first of the Nathan Active series. Set in a small village above the Arctic circle, author Stan Jones draws on his experience as a bush pilot to create characters and situations that could only happen in the Arctic. Jones' characters are complex and intriguing, and his plot line is well executed and compelling. A real treat!",59

0,Worst thing ever made,"This product was designed by an artist trying to make an attractive looking toothbrush. It is an absolute joke. The outer bristles are raised about two millimeters above the middle ones- meaning that you have to gnash them into your gums just to make contact between the middle bristles and your teeth. Then there's the beveled white part that sticks waaaaaaay out at the top of the brush that is specially engineered to destroy all the gums in the vicinity of the tooth you are trying to brush. It's like having a squirt gun where 30% of the stream goes where you are trying to shoot, and 70% goes straight into your face. There is no way they could sell this with a clear conscience.",125
1,are you listening ?!?!,this band wow. they blew me away.. if you like the screaming and the singing this is the band for you. they put on a great live show and they have awesome lyrics that almost anyone whos ever been in love can relate to. they arent just another emo band they have more to them and extra something about them. if there is one cd this year to check out it is this one. its amazing.,76
1,Good for the purpose,"I bought this camera for a small, put-it-in-your-pocket snapper, and it works VERY well for this purpose. This is by no means a high-end camera, but it captures colors vividly, but is a bit loud especially at low ISOs and the images seem (to me) to be a bit more noisy and less sharp than they otherwise could be.It's nice and cheap, and does the job well!",67

1,Early Cartridges,"This book is probably not going to be of much interest to anyone but the fairly advanced cartridge collector. However for those, it presents some good historical information on a limited group of 19th century cartridge manufacturers (Crittenden & Tibbals, Phoenix, and American) that were located in the South Coventry CT area. In fact it's the only book I am aware of that does. There are also pictures of a lot of the early cartridge boxes. Minor turnoffs are the cheap printing job, all B&W pictures, and a lot of page padding in the form of reprints of a large number of patents. Still, it's good information for those who have a serious interest in old cartridges.",117
1,Does anybody know....?,"Hi-I haven't actually purchased the soundtrack because there is no track list here... but I was wondering if anybody knew if the soundtrack contained the song that was played during the flashback scene, or even just what it was called.

(by the way... that was the best scene in the film, lol) alright, thanks!",79
1,Fits Like A Glove,"I canceled an order on a another leather case when I saw this one. The other case was generic, and made to fit any MP3 player. I would have had to take my Zen Vision out of the case to access the buttons. But I love this case! I thought that the vertical position of the (non-swiveling) belt clip would be annoying, but it was actually a great idea to make it that way. The buttons are closer when I want to change a song while I'm working out, and I can see which ones I'm pressing. The belt clip isn't flimsy either. Great Job Kroo!",106

But more often then not, it would give me a ""poor line condition"" error message when trying to send multiple pages. So if I needed to fax mroe than one page, I would have to fax them literally one page at a time. This is frustrating and time consuming b/c then you have to dial for each page. I would not recommend this fax machine.",87
0,"Old Fashioned, Boring, Waste of Money, Terrible","My 2-year old daughter got ""Mickey Saves Santa"" DVD for her birthday and absolutely loves it. I purchased this DVD thinking it would be similar, but no! Mickey's Around the World in 80 days looks like it was produced 30 years ago - very old fashioned animation and the 'educational' aspect is also very dated. I give this 1 star because my 2-year old would not watch it at all despite it saying it is appropriate for 2-6 year olds. An older child may find it more interesting. It seems to me that Disney is re-hashing old material and packaging it in a new box. Skip this DVD and get ""Mickey Saves Santa"" which is highly appropriate for a preschooler, with up-to-date animation and 3 wonderful interactive stories.",128
0,Dr. Seuss is rolling over...,"Dr. Seuss left this manuscript in a drawer when he died.

Yet this book says ""by Dr. Seuss"" on the cover just like The Lorax or Cat in the Hat. Deceitful.",67
0,Proof That The Radio Is The Black Hole Of Music,"I noticed that almost every band on the radio sounds alike. All rap sounds alike. All diva-pop sounds alike. And all radio rock sounds alike.I decided to download the ""How You Remind Me/Someday"" mp3 onto my computer for the fun of it, and I was laughing. Both songs have the same BPM, the same chord changes, wow, and I thought Creed was terrible enough.The rest of the CD isn't any good either. ""Because Of You"" sounds like something ripped off Metallica's ""St. Anger"", and ""Figured You Out"" has some of the most mundane lyrics ever.Nickelback's new album, ""All The Right Reasons"", hits stores really soon. Expect one of the songs to sound exactly like one of their older songs. Nickelback is a joke and a disgrace to Canadian music. Hopefully they will realize how terrible their songwriting skills are and retire from the music business.",145

1,Fabric Origami,"The ladies in my quilting group went crazy over this book and the new techniques it showed them. It has 24 original three-dimensional flower designs in fabric and silk ribbon. You learn to make a pompom dahlia, a lily, kalanchoe, hollyhock, China aster, an Australian waratah, passion flower, sweet pea, cockscomb, malaleuca, and others. She shows each flower in a finished project with detailed instructions to make the small quilt.There are also patterns for six purses so you can make your own elegant evening bags or give them as gifts.The steps are show in drawings with color so it is easy to see the folding and which side you are working with.The techniques taught are appliqué, Japanese sashiko stitching, beading and embellishment, all-in-one backings and borders, and others.",128

But it's almost as if two people were arguing when they wrote it: two very different people; a smart one and a not-so-smart one.There are just two many implausibilities unaccounted for.Such as: Why is it established that the infected monsters can eject infected material at a person, but then, later in the movie, you find a non-infected person standing right in front of an infected monster, taunting it, with no protection covering his face???And why, at the beginning, were the infected monkeys only encased in glass if what they were infected with was so drastically deadly???Unexplained stupidities of small detail abound in this movie and destroy it's believability for any thinking, questioning viewer.",124

0,WEAK MUSIC!!! NOT EXTREME AT ALL!!,"Limp Bizkit is sterile, play it safe music, and it is completely about cashing in. Limp is a neutered dog of a band, dragging it's a@@ and trying to make a ruckus to draw attention. They are not good at the heavy part of their music, just like they are no good at the rap part. If anyone wants to hear the downright most abrasive album, it would have to be White Light White Heat by the Velvet Underground. Unbelievably raw, it will hurt your ears. Limp fans, just give up. Everybody knows Limp is about as weak as the Backstreet Boys. They are just a little louder.",108
1,Excellent Suggestions Worked For Me,"I read several chapters of the book and decided to try out some of her techniques for getting someone to fall in love with me. Her suggestions for eye contact and smiling a genuine smile at the girl really seemed to work. Friday night at a bar I tried it on a woman half-way across the room just for fun and this beautiful goddess kept coming back to her table from visiting her other friends to see if I would come over and talk. The following day I tried it again (smile and the eyes) with a female bartender and received too much attention from her --- I really wasn't in for the kill, just experimenting. With all of the other formulas in the book I feel I can get the woman I want (as long as she is ""available"" for love), whenever I want. Read the book even if you already have a mate --- the suggestions are good for keeping him/her once found.",165

I thought it would reflect some information useable in the daily application of the advertising or PR trade as I am a consultant. Although it shows ""Advertising, Public Relations...""as part of its subtitle on the cover, very few chapters actually pertain to either. And those that appear are merely historical tracings of people like the author's pet, Bill Bernbach and his agency. The use of hightened vocabulary was not necessary. It was as if the authors were showing off their linguistic prowess rather than reaching their general audience. I should have known better than to buy this book when I read the reviews from MIT, Princeton...need I say more about ""ivory tower"" scholarship.",120

There are some major artifacts on the master used, but its not too distracting. There are definitely a few spots of dirt that should have been restored.The most important thing is that all the music is here and these episodes are totally uncut. I watched the extra of the music of Miami Vice and the interviews with Jan Hammer are excellent. Overall in the spectrum of what we have seen studios do with television DVD releases, this was very well done.Go get your copy, pop some popcorn turn up the 5.1 sound and enjoy.",136

I've always felt a little bit ""dirty"" using the 50 cent cable that came with the player so after looking into this cable I decided to get one. Short answer: waste of money. I tried this on three different up-converting DVD players and two different televisions (DLP and Plasma) and in each configuration the cable actually made the picture worse. It did brighten the image, but that was never a problem for me. I also did a blind test with some friends, and they all agreed the RazorVision made the image less clear (although brighter). If you're like me and have trouble sleeping at night because you have the stock cables, spend your money on a good therapist, not on this cable.",154
1,The first work of a great novelist,"Much as one can feel in the less mature works of Joyce, Marquez and even Shakespeare, there is the distinct feeling in this work that the author is destined for greatness. This novel is the sensitive, first-person account of the events during and after the end of World War II. At a time when Germany had been ravaged by war and the effects of its own over-ambition, Boll gives us the story a man, apolitical and barely alive. He shows us how love can blossom in and around the rubble left by the bombings and the shortages of the war. This love of his is strong, yet odd and difficult to imagine. Boll's setting of post-war Germany is seemingly the only context it could have I recommend this work to anyone looking for a novella that is deep in its emotion and broad in its observations of a culture.",149

Was that a boy? I'm still not sure. Zombie puts the great Halloween classic movie through a white trash, trailer park dumpster. And why did every reject in this movie have long hair? Was that a requirement to get the role? Even Dr. Loomis had it early on. What a joke. Can you imagine Donald Pleasance looking like a filthy hippie? Very stupid. The only good thing about this unrated film is all the hot chicks. [...] Still, this was a horrible movie. Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween IV, V and even VI (Pleasance last) are classics in my book. All the others made a pure garbage. Don't waste a cent or more importantly your time of such crap!",144

I use it at home and I'm quite satisfied with it.Edit 2/14/12Regarding the review about dumping the bass, I just don't see how that could happen if the stand was/is properly positioned (legs fully splayed) and the bass properly seated. Pushing down on my guitar with far greater force than the weight of a bass, in varying directions, I'm unable to get the stand to tip. Only when the hind leg isn't fully extended does it even become possible and that's only if I purposely lean the guitar forward (more vertical).Just an observation.",115
0,Garbage,"I am not rating this review low because it should not have been made; which is a different discussion for another time. It is low because how it was written. I can try and explain to someone who has never been to church or seen a church about church, I can present pictures, I can give detailed drawings about HOW it works and how its done. But that person still will not know what its like to be there, to actually experience church. Same is true with this. Yes, is it accurate on how things work, for the most part (albeit the author does talk about ""contemporary"" Sun Dances, which are different than Traditional). Again, without discussing why that is important as that is another topic for another time. The book gives the HOW a dance is done, but it doesn't explain the why or the what. The most important is the why and the what. It gives people a FALSE understanding of Sun Dance.",165

0,"Typical Delillo, self-important without having anything to be really important about","I found this insufferable for the same reason I find most Delillo insufferable, his language is just too incantatory and too bloatedly self-important to really take seriously. He wants to attach profundity and portentousness to everything in sight. Baseball, Nuclear War, J Edgar Hoover, Peter Bruegel, Frank Sinatra... everything becomes a part of this giant, humorously ritualized mythos, which would be fine, but unfortunately fiction needs to have more to it than the atmosphere of a catholic mass in old latin to really function (or at least is does for me). Delillo wants so desperately to be taken seriously, but his vague invocations make it obvious that he doesn't really even know what exactly he wants to be serious about. It seems like he wants to be a prophet of dread, anxiety, paranoia, really of modernity itself. Maybe instead of trying to be an important writer he should just try to be a good fiction writer.",156

I watched it scramble around inside the jar, trying to ""escape"", and thought I might even have to go out and rescue it! The traumatized squirrel finally turned itself around and was able to get out, however, I have never seen a squirrel go completely into the jar since that time. They venture no further than the opening.",115

0,If there were negative stars I would give them,"Not only did this program prove to be a lame at best excuse for garageband, but it sucked as a program. It was slow and hard to interact and develop songs with. The worst thing about it is that you can't use your own computer audio setup, you have to use their weird USB gizmo that screws up your latency settings causing disgusting noise to blare through your speakers or headphones. This program proved to be a waste of money and a frustrating headache. If you are a garageband enthusiast DO NOT BUY THIS PROGRAM. Suck it up and learn how to use Propellerhead Studio's Reason, its well worth the money!",111

0,Sub-par effort,"I was very disappointed by this effort, esp. from Magnum, a name I associated with quality photography. Some pictures were ""new"" -i.e., not the usual crop of pictures we've seen. But even allowing for the fact that many photos were taken in the aftermath of the fallen towers, almost all the pictures looked ""muddy,"" grainy and/or dull. Few, if any, of the photos popped out at you with clarity. A real disappointment. Life's commemorative issues (paper and hardcover) did a much better job, though with more predictable photos.",88

I just hate waiting a year for her next one.",59
0,Not quite...,"I was so excited about this book, after I read the reviews. The book flows well, but leaves the reader hanging. It really is not a mystery or crime novel, because although, crime does happen, the ending hangs. The bad guy is not caught, there is not closure. I guess this probably reflects real crime situations, but we read these books to get away from 'real crime' and find some measure of justice. You will not find this in this book. I will try the 2nd novel to see if it is any better.I would not recommend this book.",99

1,Great Multi purpose pan,"This pan arrived as part of a larger set several years ago. Since I got my hands on it I have used it nearly every day and it remains my favorite do everything pan. I have created everything from a delicate cream sauce that would scorch in a stainless steel or aluminum pan to perfect fluffy rice. Puddings from scratch come out perfect and I wouldn't start my ice cream bases without this pan. It took a few tries to learn that cooking with cast iron requires less heat than stainless steel, but once that was figured out, there was no stopping me. The pan is a perfect size for a single person or a couple. When cooking for many more people I often resort to my three quart pan which I don't like as much. Cleaning this pan requires no more effort than any other pan. The skillet top can also be used for terrific grilled cheese sandwiches although there is only room enough for one at a time. I would give up nearly all of my other pans if I could keep just this one.",187

0,Mainly for diehard Rush fans.,"And I would certainly include myself in that group, but of all of the band's recordings this is the one I would choose last if I was going through every Rush album. This album is to the early era what Test for Echo is to the current state of Rush affairs: neither is very good.Granted, ""Bastille Day"" and ""Lakeside Park"" are both quality songs, but that's about all there is here. ""I Think I'm Going Bald"" seems like a silly novelty song (in other words, not to be on a Rush album) and the two longer songs just seem to drag on forever with few rewards along the way. If you want every Rush album in your collection, and many of us do, then by all means add this one to it. Otherwise, you're not missing a lot if you just go on to 2112 which you absolutely must have.",150

Excellent examination of the flexibility of armor in an urban environment, and although it won't give you the broad view of a more comprehensive work like ""COBRA II"" it is an excellent detailed examination of the strikes that led to the fall of Baghdad.",83

Novak's writing skill is sufficient to draw me in to the Forgotten Realms, making the characters real and the locations almost palpable.",76

0,Ultra-soft and ultra-cheap,"These are only worth $15 on a good day. These are not what I thought them to be when I ordered them.First, these are like 100ct? Maybe? The package doesn't say, but I think if it doesn't say it's assumed 180ct. If you hold up a piece of single ply toilet paper, that's what there sheets look like. They're thin. This means that over time, maybe the course of 6 months to a year of washing and sleeping, they're going to look and feel like screens. They're soft, they're just not durable, and won't be soft for very long. Not to mention, my cat with his claws will have runs in these in no time.I'm a fan of high count sheets (450 - 500+) so these are a considerable step down. Amazon has great deals on nice sheets, so I recommend waiting for those than buying these. Those deals aren't much more than these sheets were (I think I got 1000ct for $39). I got suckered in by the price too, but really...they aren't worth it.",176

The only thing that I would have liked included would have be the electric version of ""Miss you In A Heartbeat."" It was a B side on one of the singles (off the top of my head I am forget which one). I suspect that it was not included because Miss You In A Heartbeat was a song on Retroactive but it was the accoustic version. Unfortuately, this was my favorite B side and it is not on this CD. Other than that, this collection is awesome. I now have a lot of extended versions of songs that I only ever saw/heard on MTV or live in concert. I wish the band would go back to making songs like this. Enjoy the memories.",137

It provides with plenty of examples, theories and studies done by the leading experts of leading universities where public opinion is studied, and, at the same time it explains the four W of such theories. It carries the reader from the meaning of public opinion to the impact of it in the construction of society, policies, social norms, religions, etc. It is concrete, profound and easy to read, as well as amazingly interesting.",125

With a Super Wide you know you're going to get barrel distortion, so I like to put it at its widest and get real close to a subject, even focusing on things just an inch or two from the lens.One thing of note is that is doesn't go well stacked on a telephoto lens, but that's not unexpected considering the contrasting purposes of each. I'm not taking a star off a product because it doesn't do what it's not designed to do.There are a lot of creative things you can do with this lens, and for such a small price compared to high-end fish-eye lenses, I'm definitely glad to have it in my bag.",153

It wasn't suspenseful, nor all that entertaining, nor did it feed the violence hungry viewers among us.Our main character, the radical high school prude, is not a hero, nor an anti hero. I don't particularly like her nor do I dislike her. The acting overall reminds me a bit of high school plays, especially the brother.There is not much gore and the tid bits of violence we do get are not all that wild, despite the ""toothful"" situation. Even though the premise could call for some exotically erotic scenes you'll be disappointed here as well.The cinematography and editing are by the books and I was once again reminded that too many directors don't take advantage of the variety ""film language"" can offer to create stunning visuals that tell a story or just simply entertain us viewers.

Recently (April 2007) it began exhibiting the same problem.I paid $399 for this machine, which was a huge discount over the prices I saw elsewhere for similar machines. But one more trip to the sewing machine shop and I'll almost have purchased the thing all over again, with no guarantee that this repair will permanently solve this problem.

I was suprised to find that this has become one of my favorite books. A book about true friendship and the ways in which people can be best friends yet be so different. We see the views of all four characters in the book and feel as if we know them. A book that was full of laughs and tears with an unexpected mystery toward the end. I suggest this book to anyone who wants a good summer read about women and friendships.",117
0,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed in Judith Gould's latest book. In a nutshell vet engaged to marry cocaine sniffing embezzler who is better suited for her domineering mother. Vet meets owner of large estate who had been horribly disfigured in a polo accident and has mutiple emotional problems but alas after being with the vet twice he overcomes all of his problems! There are a few other characters not worth mentioning. I found the characters quite shallow, consequently the book lacked depth. It certainly is not up to Ms. Gould's usual high standards. I almost felt as though the book was written in a big hurry to please the publisher - not the readers.",113
1,Classical Program.,"This is a dvd for lovers of classical music. It contains selections by: Corelli, Praetorius, Bach, and Handel. There are only three well known Christmas carols presented. The performance is excellent. The production values are not great, but are acceptable. If you want a Christmas dvd of classical selections, then this is for you. If you want standard Christmas carols and songs, then seek elsewhere.Four stars for an excellent performance.",70
0,A high end look with way too much high end.,"From a distance these things have the look of well crafted head phones.Up close it's easy to see that they are cheaply made.Bottom line: Way too much high end. Its distracting and sometimes painfull. I've heard sounds more true to reference from headphones that are a third the price. Save up a little more cash, do some research, and get the real deal.",63
0,Return,I returned this product. There should be a listing of tracks so people do not purchase the wrong thing. Very misleading. I thought Hidden Beach included artist Like Jill Scott. Not what I got on this CD. I will never buy another CD from Amazon that is a compilation unless the traks and artist are spelled out.,57
1,ENJOYABLE READING,"Although the book at first seems full of new informaton and new pictures it fails to meet the description of the title. As a big fan of PINK FLOYD however I found it to be an enjoyable and interesting new way to look at the works of ""THE GREATEST BAND IN THE UNIVERSE:PAST,PRESENT AND FUTURE""and therefore I would recommend this book to any hardcore FLOYD fan who already knows the stories and will not be misinformed in certain areas. One minor flaw is that it claims to include every song, but it doesn't,(there are a couple missing)probably because these were not officialy released on record. Other than that it is a good read while you listen to PINK FLOYD on vinyl.",121

0,Totally unbiblical,"It seems like Mr. Weise bought into pop culture portrayals of hell when fabricating his ""experience"". The hell he describes in his book is not the same hell that is described in the Bible. I also question why God would choose him to see hell in order to witness to the world, which undermines the absolute authority of the Bible as the final revelation. Either he had some sort of lucid dream or he is lying. Good intentions aside, I do not recommned this book.",85
0,Not Up To The Hype,"I purchased this vacuum about a year and a half ago and curse it everytime I take it out of the closet. Yes, it has great suction for dog hair and dust but don't try anything much larger. You might as well pick it up by hand. But that isn't the problem here. This unit in addition to a questionable design has one of the CHEAPEST power cables you could put on a vacuum. At almost six hundred dollars for this unit I am appalled. The plastic I can deal with but not putting on a high quality power cable is just wrong. Dyson should be ashamed of themselves. On top of that forget using the attachements. It is just dumb. Obviously designed by someone who thought they were clever but doesn't live in the real world. Forget cute and make it work. For $250 this would be an ok machine but at $599 it just isn't worth it.",159

There is a lot to do here, with some help needed for cutting, and the story of Steve and Blue and all the usual characters getting their show ready is not only entertaining and instructive for kids, but is a great setup for children's continuing play using their own ideas for the actual (or their own) show.

1,House- Season 2,"Basically, my opinion is the same as that of Season one....OUTSTANDING!! It just keeps getting better and better. This show is completely addicting. Hugh Laurie is wonderful, rough and sexy as can be! He is so down to earth, so very rough around the edges, but you can easily see he is very vulnerable underneath the rough exterior. This is one of the many reasons his character is so very interesting and appealing. It makes you want to keep watching to find out what it is ""exactly"" that has made him what he is. The other characters also mesh well together, they did a great job choosing the supporting actors. What else can I say? GREAT SHOW!",117

Atleast GTA series is different in many aspects as apposed to this boring title. First off, the game is way to easy. Hardly any changes in overall game play. This game is 99% hype and .5% joke and .5% fun. Second, I've run into graphic and image overlays and significant stutering during game play. Graphics are improved but still very much similar to Halo 1. I was able to find this game for 39.99 at a local computer store. Its not worth it. Maybe 29.99 or possibly a rental, but certain not for a purchase. If you look passed the hype, the game is nothing more than Halo 1 packaged as Halo 2.

1,A book that gives one a philosophical look at the 80's.,"One should read Johnson's book as a history of the 80's, not as a book about Reagan. Johnson paints a fascinating view of how the person in the Precedency is irrelevant, it is those he chooses to advice him. The book also verifies, ""man is not altruistic by nature."" One needs only look at what happens when institutions are given free rein; the institution will use the freedom for its own benefit.Johnson makes clear anyone can be successful, in business or politics, as long as they choose the right people to run things.",93

Still, if you've got the patience to sit down and read it from cover to cover you'll be well prepared to start growing. So far we're satisfied with our results and we've avoided many of the pitfalls of first-time growers. I especially liked the case studies, colour pictures and grower anecdotes.

The wand is a nightmare with hardly any suction at all and the accessories keep falling off if you bump anything even slightly...

1,A Great Madonna Album,"Ok, while Ray of Light may be an unfair comparison to Pink Floyd's Dark side of the Moon, Pet Sounds from the Beach Boys, or Beatles Psychedelic songs that we all love, Madonna's material on this album ASPIRE to that greatness.

I think it's one of her best albums where her voice works well with her music......and for the first time ever, I actually agree with the critics......her singing lessons from ""Evita"" really paid off on this album. She's singing at her best and her material feels more mature too.Songs that catch my attention (besides those well known hits off this album): Substiute for Love, Swim, and Nothing really matters.Ray of Light is quite unique. It leaves me longing to hear more of these types of songs from her......and that's when I know it's a good album.",161

The type is thin and difficult to read, and they start one hymn on the same page where another finishes rather than starting each hymn on it's own page. They've made the words *Gender-Neutral* (i.e. ""Good Christian Friends Rejoice"") and needlessly changed the wording on several hymns to make them more Politically Correct.The group that compiled this sorry excuse for a Christian Hymnal had a wonderful opportunity to make the superb 1940 Episcopal Hymnal even better than it already was. Indeed, they did add a couple of good new hymns, but they also deleted far too many excellent hymns from the 1940 Hymnal.All in all, it was a dismal collaborative effort by non-musical, politically-driven cretins. It is still in use by most Episcopal congregations today, perhaps partially explaining the disarray the Church finds itself in today.",141

This DVD works, although I did fall over a few times during moving tree pose...there's that non-graceful part. It is indeed something to work towards, and far more challenging than it looks.

1,"Well worth the read, but frustrating.","As literary fiction, The Story of B is just deadly; but it is well worth the read as a philosphical dialectic. The vision (not the program!) revealed is important and exciting. The greatest frustration is: what to do with the message once received? Quinn is quite clear that anything less than a total response is an exercise in futility, but he offers no other direction.

0,Really wanted to like it,"I really wanted to like this album, but...1)Some of the music is ripped off wholesale from Metallica and Megadeth.2)Some of the music is ripper off from their old songs3)The songs sounded like they were hacked together as quickly as possible, which probably caused the two problems listed above. After reading the other reviews, I'm guessing this is because the album was written in only 3 weeks. I'm actually surprised. I would have guessed it was written in 3 days.4)There only seems to be one style on the album: play heavy. There is little to no variety and most the songs sound surprisingly similar.5)All of their other albums were far better, even the bad ones.6)After listening to it, I felt like I'd bought a used car with no engine.",128

This CD was pretty relaxing and enjoyable. Although I must admit the Dear Ben song was pretty cheesy and not very good at all (and quite obsolete considering she is married to Marc), I liked the rest of the songs. Her major hits like Jenny From the Block, I'm Glad and Baby I Love You are all included on this CD. Not the most vocally impressive CD, but nevertheless very sweet. You are THE BEST Jennifer!!",119

I absolutely fell in love with this show from the very first episode! I have Season One and Two and the second one is every bit as good as the first. I am losing my patience though waiting for season three. I think the fans have waited long enough so what's the holdup. I get sick of seeing shows that haven't even been on longer than a season already being put out on DVD and they can't even compare to the Beav. I find that the shows that were before my time are far more entertaining and are not offensive like tv nowadays. So my message to Universal Studios is to get the lead out and get going on future seasons of Leave It to Beaver!,154
0,A little bit of metal wouldn't hurt?,"Fine tool for ""small delicate projects"" mainly because the wing nuts used to tighten the guide bar (for straight and circular routing) are made of plastic with a metal screw. It is impossible to tighten them enough to keep the tool working straight. On a solid wood project the tool jumped around because of the way it loosely sits in the plastic base. Because of the vibration the screws that are meant to retain the depth of cut unscrew them selves, changing your settings unless you really lock them in place. Yes; for small delicate projects, but be ready for a lot of troubleshooting and make sure you practice on some scrap so you totally know what you are getting yourself into :)",123

And, he is by no means overweight. Occasionally, he likes to mark, so we figured this would be a good purchase. We were wrong! The item is not soft to the touch, and it has tight elastic, meaning it bunches too much and tends to squeeze his belly. There seems to be extra fabric, and it almost looks like a diaper or ballerina tutu on him. He looks absurd. Our dog does not particularly mind the product, but it slips and slides, making it ineffective. I noticed some wraps on Amazon that were fleece and appeared to be better quality.

These guys are great musicians (especially Portnoy and Petrucci),but this disc lacks good songs and good production. It just sounds like a typical 90's band trying to be heavy, but with no substance.In fact they never really got it back together until SFAM. Buy ""Images"" and ""SFAM"" , avoid everything else (except maybe ""Six Degrees""). If you really want to hear these guys (most of them)play with substance and style get either of the ""Liquid Tension Experiment"" discs. Those are hands-down superior to this one.",140

It moves at such a fast pace and is so fascinating, especially the knowledge of forensic and physical evidence. After reading this book, I would question other detectives in other books who were not using such a great form of criminal detection! If you love intellectual, suspensful mystery novels, this book is a must. Another plus is that the ending of this book is so twisted from what you might have been originally thinking which is different than Bone Collector. This is the Deaver novel that should be made into a movie. You'll be fearing the coffin dancer and his criminal intelligence for weeks afterward!",131

I was armed with information from the boards and prepared to reset the factory defaults and start from scratch, but once I updated my adapter drivers I was connected without a hitch.

BUT it is ridiculously difficult to set it up for the hand/spot attachment. I think they took it to the dump or I would attempt to return it. Amazon is good about that.

Technologically, Spore is an amazing feat of programming, and it was made in such a way that content patches and expansions can be made relatively easily. The game isn't 100% perfect right now, but because Maxis made it so that they can put in the content that got put aside during production, it deserves a full score. Once a few expansions and part packs are released even the people whining about the game not looking like it did at GDC 2005 will be satisfied.",147

Will ferrell does a decent job and so do the other actors but they have so little to work with it's a lost cause.I thought their was a really funny scene in the movie with a great performance from the actor who played the outside author the firm hires to write for them. Good job! Wait for it to come out on video.",104

0,Broken jars,"I have to echo the complaints of several reviewers about the fragility of the glass cups. After chilling the yogurt and removing the lids from several of the jars, I broke off a large shard of glass. Are the lids simply too tight? Why aren't the jars Pyrex? This is a terrible problem. The yogurt maker itself works all right when the desired yogurt recipe is used. But what good is the delicious yogurt if the glass shatters when you want to use the yogurt?",85

0,An intreaguing design with obvious flaws.,"Upon purchasing my new Bodum double walled drip coffee maker, I was thoroughly impressed with its ability to make coffee, keep it warm, and interest guests. After a couple weeks of careful use, I went about my daily routine. After warming up the reservoir, I poured my coffee into the warmed reservoir (via instructions as I had every time). As I was sitting at my computer, about 10 minutes after the coffee had been prepared, I was startled by a loud ""pop"" and spent the next 10 minutes picking up glass, not drinking coffee. Being that I got the item for around $20, I am not too upset, though I would be thoroughly upset had I paid retail. I would not purchase this item again. Total p.o.s. in my opinion.",130

Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. Finding Your Voice had 5 Chapters of stalling and padding, a few solid chapters on voice, and then another bunch of filler. Take a look at the Table of Contents and you'll see what I mean. This book wasn't worth the asking price, let alone the time to read it.Now there aren't many books dedicated solely to ""voice,"" but there are a few that have a few chapters on it with material that is more than the equal of this book's.

But then I reconsidered. After all, to have something worth saying, and then submerging it in a sea of verbosity which makes it inaccessible to anyone who values their time, is actually worse than having nothing to say at all. So one star it gets.",101

And all the reviews combined only go to serve the point of this book, which chronicles a fascinating and bizarre men's subculture full of social genius and destructive ego. It verges on the brink of being a mainstream movement yet constantly sabotages itself with in-fighting.Oh, about the book: this is an amazing story. Period. It tells you the how-to along the way, but it reads like a novel. It's up there with The Dirt on my list.",100

Granted, this album was not as mind-blowing or as superb as its predecessors (1974's ""Rey Del Bajo"" and 1975's ""In Motion"") but is still chock-full of the heavy-duty, no-holds-barred ""Salsa Dura"" found on Bobby's Fania releases.",53
0,A ridiculous user's manual!!!!!,"Okay, I am no techie, I admit it, but I do not remember the last time I have witnessed a worse user's manual than the one offered by this LaPazz company, the manufacturers of DNA500 and DLA401 digital note takers. The product itself is okay at best. It is somewhat cumbersome and more complicated to put together compared to similar products but gets the job done in the end. But that user's manual is ridiculously funny. It is written in SUCH broken English that it makes the whole experience both annoying and frustrating, though at times, also funny. I find it hard to fathom that a company that invests so many resources in developing a product would then skimp on technical writing just to save a few yens.My recommendation - UNLESS you are a very technically minded person, STAY AWAY from this product UNTIL this company finally hires an English speaking technical writer!!",153

A funny and intelligent comedy with the usual shortcomings but for the fun I had I am all to eager to overlook that :-) There is one thing that is really bother me: Honestly, would you like to be manipulated the way Tom Hanks does it with Meg Ryan ? I don't think so, really... He is clearly profiting from his position to maneuver Meg Ryan wherever he wants to. At least the moviemakers were wise enough not to make Tom Hanks offering Meg Ryan a job, that would have been quite cheesy... The DVD was really nice with some nice additional features like some views over the different locations where the movie was shot. I will try to see some of the places on my trip to New York :-)",150

1,Nice Quick Read,This was a nice fast paced read. The setting contributes to the suspense along with an enjoyable plot. I have to hand it to the author for coming up with a very original ending concept. The adventure comes in waves and slowly builds to the entertaining climax. Lots of twists and turns in the story which lead to a suspenseful read. Fairly thorough description of the tropical environment sets the mood perfectly for the spooky action sequences. The plot does not take itself too seriously which allows the story to progress smoothly without a lot of unnecessary fluff. The opening chapters are fast and the rest of the book is even faster which leads to ta thrill ride of an experience.(Those of you who have read it will know what I'm talking about). It really is a thrilling journey for the characters as well as the reader.,147

To be fair, I only read the first 4 or 5 pages however, that in itself was a task. The writer strayed around the subject so often that I couldn't help but wonder if this was a book he wrote that paid by the word. The topic is very interesting and I'm sure that had the author been given legitimate editorial guidance the book had the potential to be a wonderful journey. As it is, I wouldn't buy this at any price - too difficult to follow much less to read.",123

He doesn't recommend any of his products but we have to search for ourselves.I think the author doesn't want any conflict of economical interests to offer his product line but spread the true science of curing the acne itself. It took me a long time to search and locate all the products he recommended in this book, but I have gained more knowledge in the process. I have found the acnerx kit from a company that offers all products this author recommends.I like the author' acne cure program and I highly recommend all acne suffers to buy the book and follow his program. It's a good book. You won't regret it.",139

Because of this, the whole thing just sits a little bit wrong.The item says that it is ""designed to fit women"", but I would alter that to say that it's designed to fit small women. It seems to be treated as a one-size-fits all item, which it definitely is not.Other than that, it's well-made and comfortable.",98
1,They don't make them like this anymore.,"Why wasn't this the best-selling album of 1993? I've listened to this CD countless times over the years, and I'm still astounded that it in withered in obscurity while similar-sounding but inferior products (Hootie & the Blowfish, anyone?) topped the charts.The songs are first-rate, and the arrangements are fresh and interesting, balancing sophisticated percussion and orchestration with earthier elements, like mandolin and dobro. I especially love the textural contrasts between Steve Moos's raggedy lead vocals and David Starns's gorgeous, overdubbed harmonies. If Bob Dylan and Brian Wilson had met as teens, they might have made an album together like this one.",101

The book is a mere 5"" by 5"" by 76 pages (if I counted correctly).However, after opening it up, I found that it is absolutely masterful in what it does. Most pages contain a picture of a symbol, and the accompanying text explains the significance that the Celtic peoples assigned to a specific symbol. Among the symbols covered are the triple head, the ram, the stag, heads and head hunting, and much more. As an introduction to Celtic symbols, this book probably has no peer.",107

1,The volcano eruptions at Nevado del Ruiz and Galeras.,"There are two stories in this book. The first is about the eruption of the Nevado del Ruiz volcano that resulted in the deaths of 23,000 people. The second is the death of six scientists and three Columbians in the Galeras eruption. The scientists killed were led by Stan Williams, who also substained very serious injuries. The three Columbians were local hikers in the area.If the focus was on numbers, Bruce should have concentrated her studies on the Nevado del Ruiz eruption that killed so many Columbians because of the mud slides. This was not done, but the focus was on diminishing the egotistical Stan Williams who led six of his companions to death. Both stories are worth a book of their own.",123

I don't have children of my own but it absolutely makes me bawl every time I read it. I had to get out a tissue just reading these reviews! It truly enforces the idea that a child learns to love others unconditionally when he is raised in a home where he himself receives unconditional love. As I get older I realize that someday I will be able to give back some of that love by caring for my parents. It's absolutely a perfect gift for anyone with children or aging parents or both.,119

0,simply doesn't work properly,"I have never used a printer that is as worthless as this one. It simply doesn't work! No matter what type of paper I put in it, it pulls multiple pages through -- sometimes 3 or 4 at a time. Also, the first black ink cartridge ran out after very few pages were printed. (Unfortunately, it usually takes multiple tries to print a page so you wind up wasting both paper and ink.) HP products are usually outstanding. So I guess I recommend don't go cheap -- buy a high-end inkjet or laser printer, because you'll just end up throwing this one in the trash.",105
0,Wait for the movie,"Clear out the cobwebs and dust off a place on your shelf next to the Celestine Prophecy and The Bridges of Madison County. This book will soon be taking up space there. Ever so often a publishing phenomena such as the above mentioned comes along and captures the attention of the public then drifts into obscurity. The Da Vinci Code is such a book.It is poorly written with an agenda that is as transparent as the plot. As a screen play it may succeed depending, of course, on the quality of the production. Good casting could breath life into the one dimensional characters. Although I'm not sure what more Hollywood can do with yet another albino bad guy. A good screen writer might be able to do something with the hoakie story.Keep your eyes open it will soon be coming to a theater near you.",145
0,Worthless,"One line of Rilke's poetry, is of more worth than this entire book. And the publishers comment is untrue, Rilke's biographies are familar and Rilke has been extremely well documented. Even with serious flaws, Rilke is the ultimate poet looking at life, and sharing that poetic vision in a wonderous manner. You can trash Wagner (rightfully so) for his personality and some of his actions. But the music stands anyway, completely unaffected by the details of the source; so does Rilke's poetry. Completely worthless.",84
0,"They protest too much, methinks?","This reads like one long note of denial, and the other readers' reference to O.J. is right on the mark. At this point, it looks like no one will know the truth about this case, and it will never be clear whether they had anything to do with her death or coverup. This book doesn't shed any light on the subject. It just makes the Ramseys look like they are once again exploiting their daughter.",75
1,Air King 6-Inch 2-Speed Circulating Fan #9146,"This is a great little fan. I was looking for something for my bathroom. This fits on the back of the toilet perfectly. It's great for getting rid of the humidity and moisture on the mirrors and windows after showers. It's also perfect for those of us who have an occasional hot flash! Just one thing: circulating is not the same as oscillating. Some might misinterpret the title (as I did). As far as I know, all fans circulate air. If you want an oscillating fan, this isn't what you're looking for. But if you want a little fan with lots of power that fits into a small space, this is it!",112
1,Entertaining season,"It was a good, solid season for Torchwood, but not great. The character development between Jack and Gwen felt forced and held back. The plot was interesting, but not spectacular. I enjoyed watching this season, but there wasn't anything in the plot or development that really drove me to finish watching and the pace and style felt too much like America prime time. I do look forward to future seasons.",70
1,Joey Mcintyre Proves himself on HIS SOPHOMORE ALBUM!,"Having been a male fan of Joey Mcintyre since NKOTB, I was very excited when he went solo in 1999 with STAY THE SAME. While that album was predictable and formatted, this new cd MEET JOE MAC truly shows that he has spread his own wings. He co-wrote his last album as well but this cd has a solid base of songs, melodies, lyrics, production, etc....the whole package is great! His voice seems stronger and more mature and his delivery is very convincing! I reccommend this cd to anyone who wants to hear a great POP record.....I am sure glad I bought it! MEET JOE MAC is the perfect title for an album that really introduces us and brings us into the world of JOEY MCINTYRE!! Way to go Joe!",130

1,Helix XM battery replacement.,"Works well but the reason I bought the battery is because the battery that my Helix came with was only lasting 2 days before needing charge (using it 1.5 hours per day). This battery lasts just as long, and if fully charged and not used for three days it is almost completely discharged (This also happened with the stock battery so nothing new here). I have not tried charging the battery and taking it out of the Helix to see how long the battery last fully charged and stored. In any case it works just as the stock battery so I can't complaint too much, specially for the great price.",110

It certainly will put you in the Christmas spirit.",64

0,buy this book and you'll probably go broke,"If you don't go broke paying the obnoxious price of this book, you probably will go broke using Ted Warren's strategies(if they can be called that). As a professional trader I found this book mildly entertaing. For that I would have given it a rating of 3. But the fact that this book is $75.00(!) makes it a complete rip-off. Buccaneer Books should be ashamed for putting such an outrageous price tag on this book especially when there are much better books around at much lower prices. Ted Warren does not advocate taking losses early (a very dangerous policy) or at all for that matter. Two books that offer much more precise buying and selling strategies(and have made me money) are Nicolas Darvas' ""How I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock Market"" and William J. O'Neill's ""How to Make Money in Stocks"". These are both outstanding books on investing.END",148

1,Critique of Narrow-minded Dunderheads,"This film is well worth seeing. Not only is it an intriguing story and entertaining in that sense, but it is also an excellent social critique of the narrow-minded, judgmental people in a small town in the Northeast in the 1950s. It makes one wish that the Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman characters could have fled the town and that God could have then sent an avenging angel into the community, causing garment-rending and gnashing of teeth before smiting all of the inhabitants and detroying the town in a fearsome firestorm. Believe me, the townspeople in that movie deserve it!",100

You can solve that by wearing a baseball cap but who wants to do that. I will say that the sound quality is pretty good. I ended up buying a less expensive set of headphones for 37$. They are very comfortable and have very good sound quality.You can't beat the price and quality of Audio Unlimited.",122

I read all the books I can on this topic and this work in not worthy of Mr. McKenna or the Harvard Business School Press.This book makes me think of a review I read while in Grad school about a new philosophy book.

0,preachy and ahistorical,"Having loved the book as a girl and enjoyed the earlier film versions, I had high expectations for this remake. Sadly, those expectations were dashed. I didn't have as much of a problem with the movie departing from the text, because I believe that movies always interpet the books which inspired them anyway. My objection pertains to the degree or extent of interpretation. What I disliked most about this remake was its unrelenting preachiness and the ahistorical way it projected 1990's values into the past. I thought the book was feminist and modern in its own context, and so its variant of strong womanhood should have been honored on its own terms rather than devalued by reinterpreting it in our terms, while still locating the story in the past. In so doing, this movie implied that the best, the only valid, and the most enlightened feminism is the one we know today. That's just plain old conceit.",157

He applied for a deferrment which was denied. Then and only then did he enlist in the Navy. He served only three months on his ""Tour Of Duty"" while the normal Tour of Duty is 12 months.Kerry then recieved three Purple Hearts which no commander ever approved. Kerry filled out the applications himself. Like baseball, three strikes and your out. After his three fake Purple Hearts, Kerry was sent home and started his anti war nonsense.In an exhibition, Kerry was shown throwing away medals and claimed he threw away his medals because he opposed the war. The fact is Kerry's medals are hanging in his office. Whenever Kerry is asked about this, he goes ballistic.John Kerry was no hero. He was a gutless wonder. [...]",157

0,Its not that great.,"I have owned this cassette player for 3 months now. For the price , it is decent if you also believe the short durability of all cassette players. MY rants: 1. Biggest complaint is that mega bass is more like puny bass. Liked my old Panasonic better. 2. The power button on the front easily turns on by accidental contact. Unless you pull out the batteries after every use, expect to waste alot of $ on batteries. 3. Although it hasn't broken for me YET, the battery door is cheap and looks very breakable; esp in light of pulling out batteries when not in use. 4. For some reason, my cassette player keeps shuttling forward to reverse playback when it is cold. When it warms up, it resumes its normal function. Must be averse to cold.Rave: 1.Price. Besides I had to use my Xmas certificate from last year before it expired.",151
1,Highly Underrated Movie,"So I guess I'm wierd, but I really liked this movie. The cinematic action sequences (even though performed by scantily clad women) were well choreagraphed, and digital effects were flawless (in a graphic-novel sort of rendering).

0,Cathy's review,"I was very disappointed with this book. I hate reading a book and having questions about what happened to the characters at the end. The author had way too many things going on in this book. It is almost as if he wanted to included every idea he has ever had in his life in one book. Additionally, the verse was way too poetic. The subject matter was not beautiful, so it was unneccessary to use the imagery that he did. In my opinion, there were just too many things going on in this book and its a shame that they went unresolved. This book would have been just as good if it was half the length.",117
0,RED SCARE!!!,"This movie conceals Wells's atheistic socialistic and utopic views with religious fervor of prayer. The book is not meant to show that God is merciful and will bring miracles. The book was meant to show that society is corrupt and the only way for a utopia to be built is if the current civilization be destroyed in its entirety. The book is the journey of one man not a Adam/Eve couple. This man thought he was one of the few who survived and created his own utopia out of one of the ruined suburbs outside of London. WARNING to the ignorant viewer, this movie is not a true depiction of the book it is nothing but a mask! Beware of the times, beware of the RED SCARE!",127

0,What is this???,"Wow, what is this world coming to!! This guy needs a shink. So what if a girl screwed him, it happens all the time. He should get over it and not tell me about it because, to tell the truth, I really do not care. And calling girls hoes, sorry, it doesn't cut it. He should look at himself first because, like it or not, men are bigger hoes then women and that is a fact. It's real life, get over it. I don't hate, I look at real facts and tell it like it is. And wheater you like it or not, rap sounds the same all around, it's not a joke. All they rap about is how women screwed them or how women should be treated. If that is not an insult, I don't know what is. They should rap about something that is important in life not about the same sh*t over and over again. It's boring and not realistic. Maybe a woman rapper should rap in the same way about guys.",175

I'm about half way through and keep wondering if this book was ghost written. It is truly terrible. These great characters deserve better.,67

Their style is dreamy and relaxing.'Cherry blossom girl' is a tender beautiful number with light airy vocals. 'Universal traveller' is another lilting, gentle number, faintly reminiscent of Michael Franks. 'Biological' is a slow, creepy number with half spoken lyrics.The highlight for me are two instrumental numbers; 'Alone in Kyoto', and the brilliant, catchy, 'Alpha beta gaga' with it's whistles, beeps, and lush electronics.If you like this cd, try 'Melody AM by Röyksopp.",89
0,"Slow, Ponderous Plus Change to Daughter Unsuccessful","This is a Wallander mystery but the WRONG Wallander. It is an attempt to shift the main character from the aging Kurt, star of all the other books, to his daughter Linda. Linda is not an interesting character. She is now thiry and starting out at Kurt's station herself. She is worried because a friend of hers, Anna, has seemingly disappeared. While trying to find Anna, she and her father wander into a hut which has the severed hands and head of another woman. This should ratchet up the pace and action of the book but it does not.There is a tremendous amount of interior dialogue in this novel. When it is Kurt having this soliloquies, it is ok. When it is Linda, it is boring. The dialogue in this book is the weakest aspect of the book with the leaden pace coming a close second. I can't recommend this book. The author is taking a step in the wrong direction with Linda as the lead character.",167

Personally I'll probably never go to Hawaii but thanks to Lee's book I've been taken there with Adrian Monk! This trip you can't miss! It's an humerous journey of mystery and adventure that you'll experience through Natalie Teeger's eyes and one you won't forget.

0,J.W.I. PhantoM's Pokemon Ruby & Sapphire Version Strategy Guide Review,"Honestly, since they are given the information of the game, this guide should have been a lot better. The best quality about the strategy guide is the berry guide, the stats of the Pokemon, and that it suggests that you should start off with a Torchic.It does not show hidden item locations, not to mention it clusters what you can do from the beginning with what you can do after you obtain cut and such like that. It doesn't give you levels of Pokemon in the wilderness, you don't really get told about how much money you'll get from battles or what Pokemon which trainer uses.Overall, I personally think you should get an emulator and play through the game with every last detail, and make your own strategy guide, it'd be more resourceful and with the print screen button you might actually get somewhere with getting every last hidden treasure that's waiting to be found.J.W.I.

To top that, things like his pants falling down while asking someone out, or his zipper being down when he walks into class happen to him. I couldn't put this book down.

Teish includes everything from the beginnings of Voodoo in W. African and its development in America, to altars for specific Gods, humorous anecdotes, spells for many purposes, etc. etc. etc. A much-overlooked but much-needed addition to any Pagan library.",89

Buy a set of these thin, black frames. (Note - check your license plate brackets first to make sure you can use frames with them. Especially the front plate.) Then use *four* *black* screws to screw them in. Align the screw slots for that final obsessive-compulsive touch.I like these Cruiser frames because they are extremely thin, made of metal, and have a nice black finish that will last a long time. They fit where other frames won't. I knocked one star off the review because, as others have noted, they could have been a mm or two taller. As it is though, when you tighten them down, things will flatten slightly and the plate edges should just tuck inside. If not, make sure the excess sticks out the bottom so no one will notice.",162

What a disappointment, because the concept is good and with only a modicum of imagination the results should have been great. Instead of bajo, bajas, baja, what if the verbs had been put in context?

Now in my opinion, they didn't ""sell out"" when they went to the major label. They have been slowly going to a slower more emo-ish sound, and that's fine. But for any die-hard fans of ""Blue Skies"" this is nothing like that cd. This is by far their slowest album and the tunes aren't as catchy as in past efforts. The Ataris have stayed true and haven't tried to appeal to the MTV audience even though they do have a video, but why not if you have the means to do so? Focusing strictly on the music, this is not my favorite kind of music, but it is decent. I wished they went back to their old style of punk though. This is one band that I wish hadn't grown up.",163

I didn't realize this pan doesn't have the non-stick coating that I was use to with my other Calphalon frying pan, and had significant sticking the first few times cooking in this pan. You have to use more oil than with a non-stick pan. The size is okay, the actual flat surface(bottom) of the pan is smaller(8.5"") than I would have liked. The sides do slope up and out quite a bit, therefore it is deeper than a regular frying pan. This pan would work better for braising or low-temp. cooking in my opinion. Even though without the non-stick coating to worry about at higher temperatures, the amount of oil needed for browning is a lot for me.",135

I would say watching this is very worthwhile and I recommend it to anyone. I didn't give 5 stars only because I felt they didn't stress the action one should take enough in order to reach goals. I am going to get the book which I believe does touch more on that.,78
0,Chinese QA strikes again,"I hate to downgrade Merrell as they make great shoes, this being my 4th pair. Tried these on locally and then ordered through Amazon, the 11.5 D(M), I noticed right away the right shoe was more narrow then the left. When I took the insoles out, the right insole had more of an upward curve where the shoe is more narrow. So now my left foot is comfortable and my right one is hanging off the side...Checked and they're both the same size. Oh well, other than that the shoes are nice. Now I am stuck paying twice the shipping and wondering whether or not to reorder or get something else.I wouldn't care too much about quality assurance either if I was being payed 50 cents an hour.",128

1,Great value for $,"I have gone thru 2 of the original Cybersonic toothbrushes in the last 5 or 6 years. This product does a tremendous job at cleaning my teeth. It is also excellent at flossing, although I am not consistant at using the flossing function, when I do both flossing and brushing with the Cybersonic, my teeth feel like I just came from the dentist for a cleaning! The only downside to this product is that the battery slowly degrades and eventually does not hold much of a charge. I am hoping that the Cybersonic2 is better in this respect.",98
1,Amusing Lightweight Thriller,Austin accountant Jack Grant goes to Los Angeles for a vacation and does a rich client a favor by looking in on her niece and the niece's new boyfriend. And the more he investigates the boyfriend the more trouble he encounters. Ultimately he walks into a trap and has to figure a way out.The novel is funny and well-paced. A steady diet of witty dialogue and a Beverly Hills setting make the book a good choice for an afternoon at the beach.,82

0,Reads like a high school English project,"""The Greatest Generation"" reminds me of biographies printed for class reunions or interviews published in a small town newspaper. In ""The Greatest Generation"" Tom Brokaw profiles dozens of people who served their country during World War II.Most of the profiles follow the template of: X did this during the war, X had this memory of the war, X married Y and they had these children, the war changed X in this manner, this is how X's family think the war influenced X, this is why X's friend or co-worker thinks X is a great person, and this is what X thinks of the generations to follow.Using this formula made it easy for Brokaw to do three to ten page bios on the people he met. The profiles all seem generic after awhile. The book packs very little emotional impact perhaps because it is written in an overly sentimental manner. There are very few interesting stories or anecdotes for a book that goes over 400 pages.I expected something better from Tom Brokaw.",171
1,Allows for clean install.,This really does a nice job of allowing for a clean install. Hooking my Sportster 5 direct to the head unit versus the built in FM wireless provided for much better sound.

The 2nd cup is whipped and added later after the base cools for half an hour. They also specify heavy cream: IMHO light cream actually produces a better, non-greasy product.",154
0,This Rack Doesn't Stack Up to The Wind,"When I viewed this rack on the web I thought maybe the 16g steel would be thick enough to hold 1/2 cord of wood upright during a PA winter.

If you're going to store a 1/2 cord of wood outside, during the winding winter months, heavy spring rains this product is not for you. If you are going to store a 1/2 cord of wood in the garage or near a wall, fence on a level floor that can block the wind from tipping this rack over, then buy this rack.The issue is balance, or should I say lack of balance.Needless to say, you get what you pay for. I decided to go with the 1/2 cord Woodhaven rack. For $200, I got piece of mind that I would not wake up one morning and find my stack logs tipped over.Life is too short.",165

0,Didn't like it!!,"I didn't like this show. I gave it a chance by watching season one but for me something still was missing from the story line that didn't quite satisfy me. I like the concept of Fairy Tale characters living in two worlds but the writing was lacking and didn't pull me in. On top of that the evil Queen was way over the top with her role, making the supporting cast invisible. I wasn't interested in season two, one was enough.",81
0,Not that great,I bought these because Cooks Illustrated gave them a very positive review. I bought several pairs figuring I could give them as stocking stuffers to my adult children who all are fairly serious cooks. I tried them and they were mediocre at best.

Compaq was nice enough not only to charge me $125.00 to repair it, but to erase the memory(not sure what that had to do with repairing the screen) and take nearly a month to return it to me. It took almost twenty phone calls and letter to the CEO of Compaq to get it returned. One other note. It does not come with a protective case which you MUST have. Add $25.00-$40.00 to the cost for this. It also does not come with a cradle. Add more for that. As a would-be purchaser, I would be leery of cheap manufacturing and terrible customer service.",154

1,A Courageous Memoir About Battling Depression,"William Styron is a great writer. Most readers and movie-goers are familiar with his book 'Sophie's Choice'. Most readers, however, are not familiar with the fact that William Styron had been battling with depression for most of his life.This book is only 80 pages long but it is very deep. It deals with Mr. Styron's battle with depression. It discusses his self-medicating with alcohol. He also uses prescription medication to combat his depression related insomnia (ambien). The sleeping pills made his depression even worse. He faces a despair so profound that he is unable to motivate himself to attend an event where he is to be presented with a prestigious literary award.For anyone who has suffered depression, who has a loved one or friend with depression, or for anyone interested in what depression is, this book will is highly recommended.",140
1,More Sulu,"I waited and waited for Season three to come out. Why? Because it has the episode where Sulu is fighting with his shirt off. This was groundbreaking. It was the first time the American public was able to realize how sexy the Japanese culture really is. Nowadays, you have teenagers with numerous Japanese writings on their shirts and many people getting tattoos with Japanese characters. For instance, my friend went to a tattoo parlor a few years ago and got into the trend. He saw a cool looking set of Japanese characters and told the tattoo artist to put it on his bicep. My friend had no idea what it meant until a waiter at a sushi restaurant translated the characters for him. Turns out he had the words, ""Turtle Wax"" in Japanese on his bicep. Anyway Sulu is a Japanese icon. His contribution and acting skills to the science-fiction community has made me make peace with the Japanese for bombing Pearl Harbor. I believe we are now official square.",170

0,Pooh,I really didn't care for this book. The premise of the end of the world was enticing but the 'threesome' factor was over the top for me. I truly hate to be negative about any writer of lesbian fiction but this author has too much talent to waste it on detailing all the permutations of a triangle of lesbian sex.To be fair the summary stated the threesome factor but I bought it anyway hoping the 'end of the world' portion would prevail.Save your money and read Kim Baldwin's Hunter's Pursuit instead (or any Karin Kallmaker novel.)**Remember - if you want your favorite authors to keep writing for us they have to be able to earn a living doing it.

The Aerobie is easy to use and the directions supplied with it are well-written. I recommend that you experiment with the variables involved until you find what works best for you. That is, experiment with the amount of coffee used, temperature of the water, the amount of stirring, etc.I don't think the Aerobie will be my main coffee maker, but I can definitely see me taking it on trips, where I would not take a big coffee maker. It would be convenient to take camping, too, I think. There's no power requirements with the Aerobie; all you need is a way to heat some water.",138
1,Execution tourism.,"The originality of this book is to illustrate (in both senses) anti Jewish pogroms and the death camps from the viewpoint of the Germans involved. Some, like the truck driver from technical battalion six, simply witnessed atrocities in the Ukraine. Others such as Willi Mentz (the Gunman of Sobibor), were actively involved in the slaughter in the camps. So far as I am aware, there are some original photos here showing nazi personnel at leisure whilst off duty in the camps. Perhaps it was deliberate, but there is no conclusion to the book. The idea could be to let the letters, diaries and reports speak for themselves.",107

Now they can say ""Here, read this book. It will help."" The book says that if you have low intellegence, no loyalty, don't think, and have no ethics, you will be happy and aimlessly move from job to job. If you have any of these qualities, you will be miserable. The only way I can see this book being so successful, is that managers buy them by the hundreds.

What one must realize is that gen scott has written 12 other books, the latest being ""The day i owned the sky"" in 1986. He is alive and well, 90 years young and living in Warner Robins, Ga., right outside of his hometown of Macon. He continues his work by helping raise money for the Museum of Aviation located at Robins AFB. He even carried the olympic torch when it came there, running the entire length..at 88 years old!!

That way they can forge their own opinions on these touchy subjects, based upon the homework they have done.

This movie had the same imagery and story line that reeled me in with DD. It made me feel that same sadness and closeness to the characters once again. This movie is easily put on my shelf next to DD without any reserve. watch this movie with an open mind and remember its A SEQUEL NOT A REMAKE!!!!!",117

I suppose this doesn't really make any difference, but I can't help feeling that I paid a huge premium for having someone in China stamp ""Rosle"" on this.And how much special effort is required to ""engineer"" a jigger, anyway? Eventually even the Chinese will be able to figure out how to do that without German assistance.",107

So many insignificant pages are in this book that if you took all of them out you'd have a pamphlet left!

Then heard it on a commercial when I was near a classical music type person and was able to buy it (run a search for ""go king king go"" in Amazons search engine!).I'm sure everyone has heard this music, but not this quality. Other versions I've heard (like in movies, commercials, and hockey games) are almost indecipherable. The music overwhelms the singer people in the other ones, this version seems to me to be what the composer had in mind. Of course, the composer is probably dead so I don't know for SURE what he had in mind.Seriously, this has the best balance of the 2 or 3 versions I've heard.

0,"Unfortunately, they do leak . . .","I was so glad to find disposable diapers that were both chlorine and gel-free but was sadly disappointed. I didn't find the diapers too bulky or anything, and I loved them for the first couple of days, but then I got pooped all over . . . and then it happened again . . . and again . . . and I'm not talking about a little stuff coming out of the side -- I mean poop literally dripping out of the diaper and all over the floor/my lap/his clothes. Maybe for an older baby with more solid poop they would be fine, but these diapers just couldn't contain my baby's breastmilk poop. It's due to a poor design (the inner elastic is too loose and doesn't ""catch"" anything), and if they could fix it, these would be my diapers of choice -- but until then, I can't recommend these at all.Kudos to the company for trying to make a better disposable, though; it's a good idea and I hope they can find a way to make a better product soon.",181

That's ridiculous - no publisher should have allowed this book to go on the market so full of mistakes with the author so unwilling to correct them.Secondly, the book teaches you absolutely no Math at all. Half of the lectures in each chapter are obscure, random models the author picked, and suddenly is capable of making assumptions about each model that seem completely arbitrary.

0,Price is Misleading,"When I saw the original price according to Amazon ($300) and the selling price(39.99), I thought I am getting a great deal and a great product. In fact the set does not worth even a $50. The quality is poor, it looks nice but the material is of low quality, thin cloth, less filling, poor stiching. The color in the picture is also misleading, its kind of pinkish in the picture but actually its brown.So if you are buying, don't expect the quality of a $300 comforter, it just worth $30-40",91

0,27A45 Stopped working after only one year!,"I purchased the Toshiba 27A45 about one year ago. I was happy with the picture and the sound, especially for the money. Plus, I thought that Toshiba was a reliable brand. After all, I had owned another Toshiba without problems for over 10 years!I came home yesterday to find the TV would not turn on. I pushed the power button, and nothing! I then did a web search on this model to see if, by chance, there was a fuse or something that I could replace. I discovered that I was not the only person to have problems with this model. From what I gather, the TV has a manufactering defect which causes connections to come loose. Now, after just one year, I'm forced to by another TV. Guess which brand it *WON'T* be!",134

1,Julie Andrews is the star!,"This film, in my opinion is exactly the kind of film Julie Andrews needed. She breaks free from her forever view of being ""the perfect nanny"" and becomes the maddening and infuriaiting theater star, Gertrude Lawrence.This film has some of the most spectacular numbers and wonderful scenery and costumes(that being my favorite aspect!) Julie Andrews is wonderful as the actress searching for a love to equal that of an audience. Daniel Massey plays Lawrences Lifelong friend 'Noel Coward' and he is also brilliant, his clever lines and witty attitude amuse you thoroughly. This film is my favorite film of Julie Andrews and has greatly influenced me in the genre of Musical Theater, this is one Hollywood musical you do not want to miss!!",123

0,the 3rd or 4th worst writer of his generation,"The most appealing thing about this book is the candy on the cover. These stories are, in a word, dull. No memorable characters. No gripping--or even mildly interesting--plots.One editorial review in praise of this book is telling. It calls the collection ""finely crafted"" which I suppose is roughly equivalent to praising a movie for its cinematography: it's fine if you're in to that sort of thing, but don't expect too much in the way of entertainment.In my opinion, it's Rick Moody's ""style"" that is largely to blame for the crappiness of this book. A guy in a chicken suit crashing a wedding ought to be interesting. But in Rick Moody's meandering, digressive prose, even this quirky scenario manages to become quite tiresome.If you enjoy overblown language and slim plots, you may enjoy this book. I give it two stars because it's mediocre and forgettable rather than offensively bad.",148

From the very start of the novel, I was hooked. I simply could not put it down. I only got this book in the first place so I wouldn't be bored on my plane trip. What I thought would be a semi-interesting book to occupy my interests momentarily, ended up being an obsession. Even when I reached my destination, and my boyfriend, I had to read this book to the very end. To the very end of the book I was guessing at the twists and turns the plot would take.

1,LCKSFREADER,I loved this book. I found the stories to be humorous without being glib. I travel a lot for work and this was the perfect book to pick up and be transported away from the realities of my work schedule. Morris' friendly approach leaves the reader with a feeling of endless possibility -made me want to go somewhere and do something. Each chapter introduced me to a new place and a new DIVA -I found this structure ideally suited to my reading habits and time constraints.

The practitioner used electrodes all over my body, with skin preparation as would be used for an EKG, and still the variation in readings was far greater than could be possible, thus invalid. As others have said, get calipers and learn how to use them.Also, people, forget about BMI. This was a measurement developed to study POPULATIONS, and never intended for the evaluation of individuals. Use common sense. How can a value that considers only weight and height be a valid reflection of an individual's health and fitness? Muscle is denser than fat, so an individual with minimal muscle will show a lower BMI than a heavily-muscled one of the same stature. Are we to believe that the lower BMI in this example indicates the healthier of the two? Nonsense!",148

The only Character I was interested in was Jimmy Grant played by Nate Parker, but only because there was nothing else to be interested in. I can't even relate how poorly this movie was done.

Bad brains are way better. try flesh parade or something that has humour. Watchtower are the kings of metal. American bands are way cooler except for sabbat, napalm,at the gates,king diamond, celtic frost,rudimentary peni,carcass and maybe a few or more others.

1,Best Song Of 99,Being a male my ego usually takes over when I listen to a love song and I hate it. Kiss Me however has me quite captivated with it.

1,DeWalt 6' random orbital sander,"I have used this sander for over 12 years on a daily basis and even though it may not be the most comfortable tool in my shop, I am used to it and it does a great job. Connected to a Fein vac, it is practically dustless. Contrary to the claim that 6"" hook and loop sanding disks are hard to find, I have had no problem buying them at my local wood supply store in grits ranging from 60 to 320. The tool does vibrate and is somewhat noisy, but it works fast and evenly, and since ear protection is a shop requirement (and so is dust protection), noise is no problem. I'm glad DeWalt is still making this model, because I don't know what I would do without it...",131

1,Intriguing,"This short tale was very well done, and I thoroughly enjoyed Klaus Janson's art style. One minor issue of note is that the paper the book is printed on is not exceptionally high quality, and I occasionally found it obnoxious.As far as the story goes, I believe Morrison did an excellent job. He managed to tie the villain in to an extremely important incident in Bruce Wayne's pre-Batman, pre-death of parents life; an amazing feat considering how much of Batman's past has been accounted for. Morrison very much made this story monumental to Batman's life, instead of just another villain with another agenda.My only quibble lies with the ending. I felt Batman got off too easily. I won't give anything away here, but I do not think the ending was worthy of the importance of the story itself.Overall though, an excellent read. And the ending is not bad, per se, I just think Batman didn't have to try very hard. I would highly recommend this book.",166
0,What a Mess!,"Perhaps there is more than one Ravioli Attachment for the Imperia Pasta Machine and if so I'd like to know about it. Using the ravioli maker attachment was impossible as all it did was squish out the filling (spinach/ricotta) and mash up the pasta dough into lumps that stuck to the wheels of the machine meaning that I had to use a toothpick to get it all out - and, wasted enough dough so that I was afraid I would not have enough for the dinner I'd planned for 4 of us. I switched to the perfect serrated round ravioli cutter to make my ravioli by hand. IF, by some miracle you are able to roll out some ravioli they are teeny tiny ravioli that you'd need about 100 of to make dinner for 4. What a stupid machine! Love the pasta maker though..",144

I am not an expert in glass blowing techniques but I would suppose the small hole is the result of the technique in order to make the double wall. Well, the problem is that one of my glasses has gotten water inside and I am unable to dry it out. I have left it several days over my Rancilio Silvia which has a warming tray on the top, hoping that the heat will evaporate the water inside but no result. Next step is to place it over a higher heat source, I'll try also to microwave it unsure of the results. Be careful when washing them by hand and I would advise they are not dishwasher safe.",151

Instead of trying to grasp the intricacies of the 8051, I find myself correcting poorly worded and badly structured sentences.

It's as amateurish as a paper describing a high school science-fair project. I don't think I could recommend this book to anyone. I definitely wouldn't recommend it for beginners. And, if a well-seasoned designer wanted to learn how to implement the 8051 into his/her next project, this book is an entire waste of time.",119

0,Thought this was a Christian study...,"A couple of the chapters in this workbook are worth while to do with your significant other--they give you a chance to talk about things that will affect your marriage eventually and help you and yours discuss these things and work them out before they can become a problem. But I don't recall any discussion about God, the Bible, or even any Bible verses being used to get there point across. Basically, this book says, ""Enjoy the time you have together now because when you get married, it's all downhill from there and it's going to take a lot of work with no benefits to keep it going."" That's truly the impression I got from reading the book and doing the workbook. In all fairness, I did quite reading the book and doing the study before I got to the end but only because I couldn't take anymore of their ""reality-check."" Truth is, you can have a wonderful marriage, that stays lively and full of love throughout your entire life. Bogus book/workbook. Stay away.",174

The conflicts between good and evil, parent and child, society and the individual - this carefully crafted novel explores them all - and in the midst of a gripping mystery! After catching my breath at the surprise ending, I could feel the smile on my face as Krich carefully set down the tracks for the next challenge our heroine will face.",114

1,One great story,"Since I am from the town where the movie was filmed, I obviously had extra interest in the Storm of the Century. I was surprised, however, how good the movie and the screenplay actually were. After seeing the movie, I bought the book and could not put it down, even though I knew what was going to happen. It really grabs you, while you feel for the townspeople and decision they have to make. The ending is disturbing, which I suppose it what Stephen King is trying to accomplish. Overall, I would say this is a great tale, no matter what medium you experience it in.",106

1,First Class Harry!,"Kenneth Branagh does an absolutely BRILLIANT job of bringing Shakespeare to the screen in this film. It's largely true to the script, and leaves in the treason of British soldiers that the government forced Olivier to cut in 1944. Not having to boost a nation's morale as Olivier's version did, and spurred on by Branagh's take on things, this film depicts a much more realistic image of war. Additionally due to different circumstances the French are portrayed as quite a bit more formiddable enemies than Olivier's version. However while Branagh rarely touches Shakepeare's words, it is probable the French were lampooned in the Bard's day. It's an odd mix as Shakespeare was obviously (from the script) telling a factually slanted story, however Branagh sobers it up while still maintaing a sense of glory and the promise of a bold new leader. It's a wonderful interpretation!",145

0,A Little Too Self-Indulgent,"I used to enjoy Clive Cussler's novels; that is, until hestarted inserting himself into the story lines. Each time Dirk at some point has to take a break in his adventure to meet with some mysterious hermit-like fellow (Cussler) who just happens to be loaded with crucial information about the local area. In this book Cussler writes himself into the story line as the ""Bayou Kid""-- an old timer who knows every nook and cranny of the Mississippi swamp Dirk must investigate and who just happens to have a sophisticated and well-appointed undercover swamp boat (complete with comic relief guard dog) for Dirk and his lady de jure to borrow for his mission. Yawn! Cussler's habit of writing himself into the plot may have been cute the first time he did it, but at this point it's become downright annoying. Let Cussler have his fantasies--and his books--for I shall not subsidize him any longer.",154

1,Wonderful Breakaway from plot architypes,"A stand-alone novel in the FR Harper series. I loved thedescriptions of the frozen environment; some of the best I've read inany novel (this coming from someone who lives in the snow). The book breaks away from conventional ""good vs. evil"", blurring the lines, showing both sides of the battle with intriguing characters. Don't expect a cliff-hanging plotline, but do expect a fresh look and new take on the way characters and the overall book is portrayed as compared ot other FR novels. My only complaint is that there hasn't been a sequel written (yet - knock on wood).",99

After uninstalling the (HP) scanner software the Izone software did recognize the camera and downloaded the digital images as advertised.Polariod tech support suggested that reinstalling the HP scanner software after the IZone software was installed would solve the problem.

1,A much underrated album,"Made after a long hiatus in which other groups like Leftfield and Underworld made up and surpassed the ground which 808 State had made with early albums like 'Ex:el' and 'Gorgeous'.The album is very soft and pleasing sounding, apart from the harsh rhythms and rolling beat of 'Bond' with Soul Coughing's Matt Doughty's aggressive vocals, and also final track 'Banacheq' which is a breakbeat track full of squalls and noise.But on tracks like 'Bird' and 'Black Dartangnon' the saxophone of Graham Massey comes to the fore and has a huge, soothing effect and lends the album a more mature feel, which came as a refreshment in an age which was dominated by lager, lager, lager!",115

Even Frank Sinatra's ""Mama Will Bark"" has a redeeming note in it, unbearably absent from Anka's sonic turd. It manages to combine the worst features of Captain & Tennille's ""Muskrat Love"" and the base carnality of any song by Mr. Meat Loaf.Perhaps George Orwell's prophetic ""memory holes"" cannot arrive soon enough.

0,Doesn't hold a Candle to the Original,"What a let down. I just hope the movie is not as weak as this offereing. Just never takes off. The original Broadway recording has spark and fire. This one sizzles every now and then. The vocals (with a notable exception) and the muscians are very good, but they just don't soar. It is like they are holding back. The pacing is also a little slower. The biggest distraction in this cd are the vocals of Anthony Rapp. This guy can sing, but do we really have to hear him gulp for air before every phrase? After a few listens I just couldn't stand it. Usually they will edit that out of a recording. Can't figure out why this got through or why he doesn't have better breath control by this stage of his career.Love the music, love the show, but am really dissappointed with this cd. It will be on my shelf, and the original will come off and be played when I want to listen to the music.",170

This book would have made a great magazine article entitled ""3 Tips for Better Time Management--Prioritize, Prioritize, Prioritize"".

Recommended you use a cordless impact screw driver as these screws are on tight!!! Once removed, you simply unclip the old wiper bladesd and insert the new blades and reverse the process to reinstall.One thing I noticed with these blades is zero chatter on the window. With non-silicone wipers, there is a little chatter as they wear in and a lot of chatter when they are worn out. These wipers were absolutely smooth and my windshield in winter mode or summer mode (if you own an RL, you'll know) work flawlessly.Worth the extra few bucks and Prime delivery was fast (2 days).",179

However, he also suprised me by writing about ""average guy"" things like beer,gambling, big screen T.V.'s, Mardi Gras, and strip clubs. I am glad Drew didn't get too caught up in stardom and forget his average guy traits, and this book proves he didn't. If you are unsure if this book will offend you, read some of the short stories. Those would probably be the worst part of the book, vulgarity wise. I don't feel offended by them, because I know these things happen to people. I certainly don't think of Drew as a sleaze or something because he made up stories like these, I believe he just wanted to show people that stars do have problems.",154

I even tried tieing the pitcher to the maker and it still leaked. It leaks right where the tea comes out and is supposed to go into the pitcher . . . but for some reason the tea just runs down the side of the maker.

1,Above Average,"I've enjoyed Madden since the days of Super Nintendo....This yeasr madden was good but not great...the precision passing, does take some time to get used to, but it fits into my ""spread em"" type offense quite well....One major negative I have about this game is that, in dynasty mode, it seems as if every player's rating goes up. Whether the athlete sits the bench or not they go up. As you can expect, this causes major cap problems. Further, any guy who you do play (especially a Safety) goes up. Therefore, if you draft a Strong Safety in the 7th round, give him 3 years and he will be a 90. At one point, about 15 years into my franchise. There was only 1 QB ( the one on my team) in the 90s, whereas EVERY strong and free safety was at least a 92 rating. Despite this negative I still play the game constantly because it is quite addicting.",160
0,Doesn't work half the time,"This litter box is a good idea, but the bugs still need to be worked out. The litter sticks to the box most of the time, which prevents the rake from cleaning the box. In the end, most of the time I have to still clean out the litter by hand, completely defeating the purpose of even having the thing. In addition, the motor is really loud, and when it encounters an obstacle (i.e. clumped up litter sticking to the box) it makes three passes before finally shutting down and blinking the light that shows me that the box has yet again failed to perform. I even have to shut off the box at night. Otherwise I'll be woken up by the sound of the rake going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Better to wait for the next model, which hopefully will be more advanced than this one.",155
1,A great resource and entertainment.,"In this book one is taken aback by the quality of the look a likes that the author uses, then the amazing generosity of information for the aspiring performer to get into this surreal business.

0,Feast or Famine,"If you can get Norton Ghost to work on your machine, then the software can make a cloned image of your hard drive for quick restore. However, notice the word ""IF"". Instructions for using Ghost are not straight forward. Creating a sucessful clone can be a real challenge. Additionally, there is no try before you buy option, so if Ghost doesn't work with your system, you are out of luck. I've had much more success with a program called Drivebackup from Newtek, Inc (NTI). With Drivebackup, I easily made a self-booting image copy clone of my Windows XP laptop computer for emergency purposes. Plus, NTI's website has a trial download option so you can make sure their program works on your machine before purchasing.",124

1,Provides excellent knowledge about Tibetan Medicine,"ITem was shipped new and arrived in excellent condition. DVD provides a beginning knowledge about the almost lost art regarding Tibetan Medicine. As indicated in the DVD, there are very few doctors that still retain this knowledge and practice. Excellent overview but it is all in subtitles and obtaining any of the medicines/herbs seems as though it would be difficult. They take a wholistic approach and specialize the medicines for the person. You would need to go to India to get a diagnosis regarding your condition. Too bad it is not closer.",92
1,One of our favorites!,"Our one year old loves this movie! Carly Simon does a wonderful job singing. Although my husband and I catch ourselves humming the songs throughout the day, the songs are really good! We used to put it on just long enough for her to sit still so we can change her or do a quick chore. She's slowly losing interest as she has become a toddler, but we enjoyed this movie. Yes, there is a brief moment where the characters are in trouble, but they recover quickly. Its not that terrifying and its not a bad thing to introduce that there are dangerous situations out there! There are a lot of little lessons in the movie such as meeting new people and not to judge them by their looks and that anyone can help with a project, no matter how small the task may be. This movie will be in our collection for a long time!",156
1,Heavenly Hilarity Hits Home,"The audio version of this book delighted me tremendously. I found myself laughing out loud. Not only is the story a funny satire on the state of the art in self-help but on the ancient forms of ""holy"" self help, with a little divine intervention, as well. Perhaps my Catholic past and familiarity with those who serve added a solid base for appreciating the humor, satire and fun of the work. Two colleagues thoroughly enjoyed the audio version. One felt a bit grief-struck when the tapes came to an end; the other said he laughed and laughed and found the whole story delightful.",103

Her playing is charming. And her lyrics are fun and clever and intriguing. I've played it for friends, and they've had to laugh, too. No, she'll never be mainstream, but she'll have a loyal following...",92
0,Big waste of money,"This is one of the worst toys I have ever purchased. Luckily I got it on sale so I was only out $20 but even at that I was angry by the poor quality of it. The hair is impossible to get a comb thru. It was just a big ball of fuzz in the back when we took it out of the box and it still is. There was no way we could make it look good. The ""make up"" and ""nail polish"" changing colors did not work nearly as well as it should have. Just a piece of junk.",101
1,Dancing With Redemption and Drowning is Desire,"The first African American serial novel written by ten authors detailing the erotic journey of a young man's quest for redemption. With different writing styles, this tapestry of fiction unfolds without a hitch. Each author wrote their own chapter with Sekou writing the first and last.When Butterflies Kiss is loaded with redemption and desire. It is the story of a young man coming of age and finding his own place in the world. The first of ten authors begins the story with Dante, a poet who has more than one woman in his life and many desires.Butterflies are very mysterious critters, imagining them kissing is tough. The correlation between Dante's struggle with life and the butterflies is truly a work of art.",122

Well, it seems that Amazon has not, and likely will not fix the issue with shipping non-us product and fails to tell the consumer it is doing so! To me, this is a breach of trust to the consumer. I have bought numerous Canon products from Amazon with no issues till now. After speaking to 2 customer service reps, who insisted the problem was Canon's, not Amazon, I have now lost faith in Amazon. They swore it is Canon who is supplying them these non-us parts to sell and Amazon is just doing what Canon wants..... They seriously need to fix this problem or inform the consumer on their use of non-us product and price it accordingly.",128
1,Extremely Cool Film!,"For Lovecraft mavens, it doesn't get a lot better than this! Made by serious fans as a labor of love, this film faithfully translates a virtually untranslatable story to the screen. The central conceit - making a film in the style of the era when the story was first published - is brilliant, and while the film's (extremely) low-budget edges certainly show, they lend a charm to the whole undertaking. At 47 minutes, it never wears out its welcome and as a silent film, it captures the feel of the original story in ways that a lot of dialogue simply wouldn't have. This is a delightful romp, if that word can truly be applied to an author whose work virtually defines the idea of ""dread."" For any Lovecraft fans, this is an absolute must-see!",134

1,Thorough and Well Done,"I've been involved in tracking off and on for about 10 years now. I thought it would be fun to swap from SAR style trailing/tracking to the AKC sport instead. Since I have a pretty strong background in the sport, I wanted to know the nuances of AKC style and what was required for the TD/TDX title as well as looking at various tracking programs people had developed.There are several old and new books that are recommended by trainers when you start out tracking and after reviewing them all, this is my favorite book of them. I blends all the things I preferred in the different books into one simple and easy to follow program that helps you understand in plain terms why and what you should be doing. Within a week, I had a dog doing the 100 yard tracks confidently and happily.If you only want one tracking book, I recommend this one!",154

When I inquired to the store why they would even sell an item that was so outdated they said I should have read the entire selling page....copyright 1996. I never realized there would be calendars in it from 14 years ago. I was also blindsided by all of the great reviews. How could the other reviewers rave about a book that is so outdated.

The best part about the book is the exams, but there are many other books out there that also have practice exams and also explain the solutions better.

It is hard to get a feel for how well you would do on an actual exma when it is impossible to complete the exam fully due to not having answers that have anything to do with the questions.

0,there are other cameras out there better than this,"First of all I understand that a digital camera under 30 dollars is not going to give you high quality pics. I assure you this camera indeed does not take very good pics, the pics are somewhat blurry, not crisp at all. I bought a cheapo camera attachment for my pda a while back that took pictures of simalar quality.Although this camera might be usefull for taking pics of items youre putting on Ebay or maybe of houses if youre a real estate agent and don't need big quality pics, you can do better. There are cameras out there the size of a credit card that takes pics that are no worse than the ones this one takes. Shop around for a smaller camera if picture quality is not of tremendous importance.",132

0,Borderline hack-work,"There are three different aspects in this book. Part of it is an argument that a technological human society previously existed and was wiped out something like 15,000 years ago. In this regard, the book borders on the absurd, not much better than the works by the ""aliens-built-the-pyramids"" crowd.The second aspect is the end-of-the-world fictional narrative. Just watch the movie ""The Day After Tomorrow."" I think it was inspired by this book.Lastly, there is a quasi-scientific attempt to explain how a rapid and drastic change in the global climate could occur. This would produce a global storm of biblical proportions that could usher in a new Ice Age. This would happen in a matter of months and not years (or decades).Mildly interesting but, keep in mind: neither of these authors has any real credentials. I don't have much confidence in the science behind the claims but it's not a complete waste of time, if you like end-of-the-world books.",158

1,Wonderful absurdist journey,"This highly inventive novel captures readers within the first few pages with its vivid and personal descriptions of the tormented, pretentious, and hilarious mind of the writer (read ""artiste"") protagonist. Those who have felt caught between the worlds of adolesence and adulthood and those who have wondered why we bother to call art ""Art"" will find a comrade in arms in this author. His ability to peel away at human pretense and expose the inherent absurdity of life is both ruthless and gentle. The scenarios he builds are profoundly implausible but uncannily truthful reflections of the essential human condition. A must read for lovers of surrealist masterpieces -- like ""The Master and Margarita"" or ""Love in the Time of Cholera"".",120

It is a many-faceted reading experience, full of side-splitting humor, pathos and drama. The characters are incredibly well drawn and believable. Even though this is ""based on"" the DJ's experiences, I am sure it is about as real as it can get without giving away identities. It is even educational and informative, regarding the radio and DJ industry. Best of all, it has a spiritual dimension, which is hard to define in a brief review. You will just have to read it to understand how that can fit with the topic. Awesome!",106

You won't be disappointed.",57
1,A success,"I've read this book twice, and each time I had the same feeling about it. Very satisfied.one could feel the heat and dust coming from the story as if he were living with the characters.Ruth Jhabvala is very talented in describing every little detail and makes you live inside the scene, especially when she comes to describe the state of India and the crowed, disgust, infections, and poverty.I really felt disgusted reading some lines that I had to stop for a moment thinking of what I've just read.What I liked the most is having two parallel stories separated by two generations.The first woman is the narrator who travels to India to discover more about the scandal of Olivia, and unconsciously she follows the same pathclaiming that India changes whoever lives there and finally the two characters experience the same end.The language of the book is simple and fascinating I think everyone would enjoy it .",155
1,Beautiful story about mother daughter love/hate relationship,I loved this story. It was an easy read and kept your attention at all times.

0,Fine acting,"The acting was fine. I was expecting something a little lighter, so maybe it's my expectations that make me think they were going for something they didn't quite get. They seemed to be presenting information (spoilers) - the mental health issues mixed with the alcoholism and everybody in town knowing about it except the main character and Patrick Wilson's sister's encouraging behavior (not a well-written character - too obvious with her sycophantic behavior) that finally points the main character into realizing how lucky she is not to live there (too easy). But there is no resolution to any of it and it makes very little sense (I suppose they were trying for a little slice in the life of a mentally unstable person). They also throw Patton Oswalt's character in like a bone for a dog, so to speak, to show how really selfish and self-involved she is and yet totally confused.",152

Also, with all that room on a B-ray disc, you think they could make the segments longer than a few minutes; what happened, did the fishy's union demand overtime or something? It's not like there is huge overhead filming a tank of fish with a stationary camera. Waste of money.",63
0,Disappointing portrayal of Bernadette,"I do not agree with the unquestioned assertions that this film is more historically accurate. A sometimes flippant, borderline sarcastic, and not very humble Bernadette portrayed in this film is not at all an accurate representation of her story. Accuracy is not determined by chronology but by accurate representation of the Catholic imagination, which was brilliantly captured by Jewish author Franz Werfel, upon which the vastly superior film ""Song of Bernadette"" was based.God chooses the lowly to give witness does not mean he chooses someone we would like to think of as being just like us, in all our splendid stupidity and shallowness. No. The saintly are and were different than us and deserve to be shown more respect that this film manages to do. Actually the sequel to this film, The Passion of Bernadette, is far superior, because Bernadette is portrayed with a greater sensitivity and greater level of holiness.",151

I picked up the book excited to read about someone elses perspective on the war, I was very disappointed to read only about how miserable one person was on her very brief deployment. Iraq is what you make of it, and complaining only makes it worse. Don't get me wrong I have great respect for the patient care but thats where my apprectiation for this book ends.",120

The second had one charging port that wouldn't work at all. I kept the third one and use it to soft charge AA batteries only when I'm around. There's no way I'd leave this thing unattended for the hours that reconditioning cycles require. I just tried a soft reconditioning of some AA batteries, and the unit keeps getting frozen in the discharge phase. I've let it sit overnight with no change. Even when I remove the batteries, the display stays frozen until I unplug the unit.I have always loaded the batteries with the correct polarity, in the correct order (highest capacity > lowest capacity), and always on a hard countertop with plenty of air circulation.I just got a MH-C9000 from the same manufacturer, and so far it's working great. I may get another and dump the MH-C808M. This is not worth the fire risk.",171

It's been handed down the generations - first her sons, then to me, and now it's being passed on to the newest members of the family. The illustrations are simple, fun and darling - ""Where the Wild Things Are"" meets ""Where's Waldo?"" - there's just so much to see in the small details. The story itself makes us feel connected to our Filipino roots, and for the family members born abroad, it introduces them to their culture.I would love to get more copies of this book to pass onto friends' children but it's no longer available. I wish the publishers would reconsider printing it again.",126
1,Best movie ever,"I must say this movie is by far my all time favorite movie. I have literally watched it 40 or more times and it still hasn't gotten old. I first bought this movie in UMD format for my PSP (original). But finally I decided to buy the dvd format because I have pretty much always wanted to see it on a bigger screen. I would buy the blue-ray version (Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete, I think), however I'm in no mood to pay a bit extra even though my PS3 (original) would play it very nicely. Plus its not really worth the extra money just to get better quality when the movie is great in any format. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves fantasy and role play games. Even if you have not played a single Final Fantasy game in your life, the movie is amazing.",151

1,good album....ok dmb album,"The album certainly has some great songs on it. Song like Everybody Wake Up and Hunger for the Great Light are remeniscent of earlier fan favorites like Rhyme/Reason. What sets this back from some of DMB's classic albums is this: Leroi and Boyd are not featured nearly enough. What sets DMB apart is the way all the musicians come together and the powering solos of the Violin and the Sax. This CD is a bit too raw for most hardcore DMB fans. I do think that when they play these songs live the band might have something up theyre sleve, as they always do, and throw the sax and violin into the songs a little more. So thats it. It's good music, but its not what you have come to know and love from DMB. Experimenting with a well known Pop/HipHop produce...probably not DMB's greatest move.",146

1,Perfectly scented,"This body wash has the exact scent as CK cologne, as far as I can tell. A little goes a long way, compared to regular body washes. It is a nice consistency and leaves you feeling luxurious all over.",39
1,this is the one you want,"Best nonstick, and you can flip the griddles over to cook pancakes or pressed hot sandwiches, like a panini. Heats up fast and works like a champ. It's a little tricky to clean around the handles but well worth it anyway. You can put butter in a metal bowl on top to melt. This seems to be the same as the design GE made for decades and it costs about the same as buying a vintage one on an auction site, maybe less.",83
0,Rent but don't buy,"Ok, I bought this game, and I was impressed. The graphics are incredible, the story is original (if juvenile), and it was all around amusing...for a good ten minutes. Pikmin then begins to devolve into something little more than brainless drivel. The concept seems fairly difficult before you play the game, forcing you to control not only the half-inch Capitain Olivar, but an army of quarter-inch centurions. After playing the game, you realize how infantile the gameplay actually is. Great gift for small children, great to rent if you're bored, but don't make the same mistake I did...don't waste fifty dollars on this game.",104
1,Great item if it wasn't missing parts,I had to order two of these and the second one was missing parts too! Its a great item but why are so many parts missing. The manufacturer was quick to send out the missing parts but still its dissapointing when you can't put something together.,46
1,Useful and Easy to Use!,"I speak no more than 8-10 words of Italian. I used this book on a recent trip to Italy, and was able to understand almost every menu item I saw, and to order with confidence. It's a marvelous book! The alphabetical organization makes it really easy to use when you're sitting in a restaurant faced with three pages of Italian on a menu.I've ordered the similar volume for Spain for an upcoming trip there, and will always look for this series for future trips, even to countries where I can speak the language.",93
0,Worst Vacuum ever!,"We bought this vacuum on the strength of its reviews here and in Comsumer Reports. Everyone seemed to love it. However, we have had this vacuum less than 1 year and have already had to replace the belt 6 times!! We also had problems with the motor overheating. When it works, yes it does OK. Our problem with it is that it almost never is in working order! Junk! Don't go near it!",73

1,PREFERABLE ONE BUT NOT GIVEN ALL ANSWERS TO VERIFY,This is a book featuring a good explanation both mathematical as well as physical.One of the better books in the field of circuit analysis.But there are no answers for even numbered problems which is the main problem with it.The exercise problems are challenging though it is the essential in creating interest.But I've found that the terminology used is ANTI-ENGINEERING LANGUAGE.I've got 80%satisfaction. Meet you later..Byaeee,65
1,Really good on the details!,"I have found this to be of immediate value in figuring out who made what. No, it doesn't have all the answers, but covers most things pretty well, and certainly better than any other reference I have. A must for any serious collector or dealer of American silver.",48
0,Terrible!,"I watched this movie once, and it made me feel stupid just for buying it. It's horribly innacurate, and terribly made. The characters have about as much depth as poetry by Homer Simpson. Rent it, then do the video store a favor, and burn the tape.",46
1,Quiet Blade,"As has already been pointed out here, this blade has minimal runout and performs extremely well. As a professional cabinet maker that has used just about every blade out there, I can say that this is hands down my favorite. And if you have a task that this blade isn't really suited for, Tenryu probably makes one that does the job better than any other available.One thing I have not seen mentioned yet in these reviews is how these blades sound. They seem much quieter in use to me, and while this may be purely subjective, the tone they do produce has a very satisfying quality to it.Simply put, if your are obsessed with having the best, ditch the freuds and forrests and get some tenryus. You will not regret it.",131

1,Queer is tasty,"The good thing about this book is that is it so simple to read. The words flow perfectly and you dont get tripped up on huge words that nobody knows. The actual story is about a homosexual smack addict and you really feel for the character. You are hoping the best turns out for him and his lover. The character is very likeable. I only gave it 4 stars because the book in the end goes nowhere. Not a great ending, but definitely an enjoyable book.",86
1,A Fabulous Introduction!,"Dr. Christianson's ""Writing Lives is the Devil"" is a quality choice for readers who want to learn the inside dealings of how a biography is written. The style Christianson uses to write the articles flows and shapes into a simple story the reader can easily follow. His articles on the back-door operations of a biographer at work clearly illustrate how complex the profession of historian can be. With several references to his previous works, the reader becomes enthralled in the lives of many of his subjects and may very well want to dive into the other biographies. ""Writing Lives is the Devil"" is a great choice for would-be biographers to learn the tricks of the trade, and for a easy-reading for current biographers as well.",125

The cleaner does spray steam, but the temperature is lukewarm at most. All it was doing was dampening the surfaces I was cleaning!! I could do that myself and save the $100 dollars I spent on this sorry excuse for a squirt gun. I then came back to Amazon to review and express my terrible experiences with the Shark. Before I did though, I read the other reviews. (...)",91
1,Scary!!,I 1st saw this movie in 1979-1980 and It's still as scary now as it was then. Great plot that follows the book very well!,25
1,A Very Good Book,"The first I had ever heard of the USS Indianapolis was in the movie Jaws. Unfortunately my history classes in school did not cover this subject. Apparently they felt it was not a big enough part of World War II. But this was a tragedy full of mistakes by many. The ship was not noticed missing for days, it was sunk after the end of the war. The sailors faced certain death from dehydration or being eaten alive (sharks) and the Captain was court-martialled for following procedures.This is an exceptional book that will keep your interest and enlighten you on a subject that many do not know about. I can not compare to other books on the subject as this is the first I have read. But it was well worth my time to read it.",136

0,Disappointing Self-Absorption,"Numerous contemporary British psychotherapists, of which Orbach is one, have written compassionately and insightfully - for the lay person as well for pracitioners - on countertransference. Orbach has a clinical practice. Of course she is a good person who wants the best for her patients. But in a leap of faith, she has made up the stories, invented the patients. This is not about her clinical practice. It is about her. These fictional patients exist as vehicles by which we learn about Susie Orbach. Very disappointing. In addition, The book has been tarted up for publication and hoped-for sales by the use of the word ""sex"" in the title. We learn very little about her process, or even her respect for, interest in, or conflicts with with her (made-up) ""patients."" A hodge-podge. I came away feeling that in Orbach's view, the most compelling subject is - herself.",147
1,Cute Alligator,"I bought this for my little boy for his first birthday. He is attempting to walk and I hope this will be the motivation to get him to walk more. He loves watching me play with it and it's very durable. This is one of those toys where he won't grow out of quickly, like most toys I've seen. He can play with this inside and outside and have a constant companion.It does make a clacking sound but it's mild compared to the noises other toys make.",87
0,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"Cute camera...however it does NOT work. I should have known from start when putting the film in to operating it, nothing was easy. Used the 12 exposure film that came with it and also used a 24 exposure on Christmas Day. Only a hand full of pictures turned out, the rest were double exposures and blanks. I don't think the film advanced right. Santa will be replacing this one.",69
1,It's a well written book.,My sister introduced me to the Twilight saga and I'm very happy to say that she did. The book was a well written series. There was only one problem that I had with the series and that was the character of Veronica. (If you haven't read the series STOP now!!!) To me the start with the character was that she was unstopable and then in the 3rd book she comes to death in one chapter. To me this seems unfair towards that character and the build up that she was given. Other than that I would highly recommend the series to anyone and trust me it gets addictive. Enjoy!!,109
0,Very bias,"I am a new, brand new student in philosphy. I didnt like this book. I felt it promoted religion. It was extremly bias and I was offended by him knocking on voltaire. It refused to question anything but his own ideas. Apparently this guy was a pastor? That explains it. I dont want to persuaded into a religious front. This book is supposed to show conflicting viewpoints. It doesn't.",69
0,Wouldn't have bought it with my own money.,"I have extremely curly and thick hair, down to about my shoulders. My friend gave me this straightener last year because she had 2. At first, it worked pretty well, but soon my hair started getting caught in the corners of the plates and ripping out. Also, it makes the ends of my hair look REALLY damaged, like I have all split ends, and it makes them feel like hay. The top my hair looks pretty good, but I would not replace this straightener if it broke.",87
1,Mostly flawless Product,"So far my little penguin is blowing out the humidity and bringing a smile to my face whenever I look at it. It does the job nicely, it's easy to assemble, to fill and to operate. My only problem is with the manual. Crane puts out several varieties in the shape of different animals and my manual had photos of another version -- not the penguin I had bought. And the parts differ slightly from each, so you have to do a little guessing as to where things go. Things get figured out fairly quickly, mainly because you keep moving the parts around till they click into place. Anyhow, it's all together now, it works okay and so far, it looks like a winner.",124

1,Great Book,"Being a cookbook fanatic and just having had surgery, I was on the prowl for a new cookbook that would help me with my weight loss journey.Boy did I find it. :)My favorite part of this book shows you the serving sizes for each meal for several types of surgery and non-surgery portions. And even a timeline as to when you can eat it.. and how.I have tried several recipes and they are very enjoyable. The cover recipes is especially good.The only thing I caution is that the time frames for many of the dishes are not in accordance with what my doctors advise. However, each doctor is different and you should follow what they say no mater what. The book is only a guideline and can't encompass every doctors wishes.",131
0,Are you a Maniac for Maniac Magee...(for me it's not joyful),"Maniac was a good book, but, it was a little confusing and hard to keep up with because, he traveled to so many places throught out the whole book. For example, Holidaysburg, Two Mills (*east and west end), Valleyford, and other places in Two Mills. It also was a sad story because, people died for example, Maniacs parents and Grayson. Also his family relationships have died for example, Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan, The Beales, The Pickwells, and the McNabs.",80
0,Disappointing,"I bought this book because I wanted to learn about Native American customs and practices in a novel format vs. a reference type book. While it did give me some insight into Navajo culture, the book is written at about the 3rd grade level. It was mildly entertaining if you want a no-brainer type of book. But if you want something you can really sink your teeth into, this isn't it. The characters lack depth and the plot is hokey. I wouldn't recommend this book.",85
1,MOST HONEST AND FUNNY BOOK I EVER READ!,"This book basically throws in your face all the rotten stupid pathetic excuses we give for the jerks in our life and makes you realize that it's not ""ok"" to settle for crap and that it's better to alone then with someone and ""lonely"" ..The book hit home like no other and I recommend this book to any successful, talented, beautiful woman out there who is still asking herself why she keeps attracting losers and accepting less then what she deserves. You will realize that the excuses you've been given to these losers is a joke and that they aren't worth a second more of your time. Thanks Greg and Liz.

1,Another five-star review,"I first heard this recording when I got it out of the library and found it so incredible that I had to buy it for myself. The sound is warm, not tinny like the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields (the other recording I have, which I've never been terribly fond of), and very expressive. I cannot add any technical comments to the other reviews already written, but I can say that I agree that Trevor Pinnock and Simon Standage are a Baroque musical force to be reckoned with.",90

There's something extra poignant watching the priviledged lose control of their magic kingdom and suffer the worst by way of some malfunctioning mind's doings. The plot builds as the clock ticks and you become aware you're not really sure of just what happened down there. As you figure it out, you are introduced to one warped a** psyche.

If you have already seen screen shots out there on the web, you'll have an idea of how average it looks, well take it from me, it sounds worse than it looks. The noise that emits from the ATVs is beyond irritating. Looks are not the be all and end all of good games, it is simply a real shame ATV Off Road Fury does not play too well.Sony have really failed to deliver with ATV Off Road Fury.

0,"Good Season, Bad DVD","This was a season which returned much closer to the quality of the earlier seasons but that is not what the review will cover.After 7 years of being aired 1.33:1 full frame while their brethren on NBC were upgraded to High-Def, scrubs finally began airing in 16:9 widescreen on ABC during it's Eighth season. If you picked up this DVD you wouldn't think that because the season is not in it's Original Aspect Ratio of 16:9, but once again in a dreary 1.33:1 full frame. This far into the lifespan of DVD there is NO EXCUSE for releasing a title outside of its OAR. It would appear this is some manner of underhanded ploy to force people to buy the Blu-ray in order to watch this season as intended, and I am very disappointed.",134

0,"Unacceptable color ""calibration""","I tried the Huey on several pc's, using several different monitors(CRT and LCD). In every case, the colors were severely off. Defective unit? Possibly, however I believe that the Huey is just not up to par. Unlike other calibrators, the Huey doesn't help you manually correct your monitor. Instead, it does some display tests, and makes adjustments through software(the profile it created) to get the desired effect. In other words, it doesn't calibrate your monitor at all, it simply adjusts your pc's video output. Unfortunately, this method doesn't seem to work well.I would suggest spending a little more and getting the Spyder2. It will actually help you adjust your monitor, not just ""calibrate"" through software.",115

I purchased it about 10 years ago in USA with Jim Kepner's ""Becoming a people..."" and Terry Boughner's ""Out of All Time"". They are very nice and intersting volumes. In these books, however, we can find only the occidental people with few exceptions ; e.g. Mishima Yukio, Suleiman . Though English has become nowadays as if a kind of LINGUA FRANCA , I don't understand why the English speaking people still have such a narrow-minded thinking. I'd like to read more international, global and comprehensive books.PS : Noel I.

Cinderella rocks in their finest tradition in this body of work. Why is this still not in print? Makes no sense to me. Beg, borrow or steal a copy and you won't be sorry if you are a true Cinderalla fan. I surely hope Tom's voice improves well enough to put out one more album of this caliber. By the way, Cinderalla sounds as good live as they do in the studio! I saw them at the House of Blues in Chicago and they ROCKED. Never heard a bad sound so close to their studio sound. They really do sound exactly like on their CDs, unlike most bands. And they still look cool too. :-)S.C.Chicagoland",133

It takes ages for the clumps to harden, and if you scoop before they do you end up with tiny little balls of funk that fall right through the scooper.After only ten days I threw the whole smelly mess out and moved on to the Dr. Elseys brand, which is nice but I think I will go back to the Feline Pine Scoop after this.Overall, totally disappointed and I can't believe how much this terrible product costs!",149
0,small brush is too hard!,"I bought this solely for the nipple brush since I couldn't find one sold by itself easily. I think the nipple brush is unusable. The bristles are so hard and sharp I'm not willing to use it on the nipples because it might damage them. In fact, I think I see scratches on the pump parts that I've cleaned it with. You can see in the picture the bristles don't go all the way to the top which also reduces its usefulness.",82

While he waits to find out what his job is with his friends, Asher and Fiona, he does volunteer work at places like the house of the Old and the Nurturing center to help the committee decide what his job will be. But when he gets his assignment he realizes why he must live in a perfect society and why he was given this job. Jonas also realizes why there are so many ""community rules"" he must follow.

0,Ugh,"Wow. Vanilla Ice thinks he's Korn. And with Korn's producer behind the boards on this one, who's to tell him he isn't? Though the drums pound and the guitars roar, no amount of hard-rock trimmings can hide the painfully obvious: the Ice still can't rap. He proved it recently with his unintentionally hilarious cameo on the last Bloodhound Gang album. Hell, he proved it with ""To the Extreme."" The scary thing is that ""Hard to Swallow"" has actually been selling decently. Personally, listening to this entire CD was a grueling experience; I had to fight the temptation to tear it out of my stereo and put on something more stimulating. Like the Spice Girls. Or that CD of cats meowing Christmas carols. Anything but this. So bad that it makes Limp Bizkit look positively brilliant.",135

Our Constitution is probably the most revered document in U.S. history. Yet it was written long before automobiles, airplanes, telephones, or the Internet, and a lot has changed in our country. Labunski's point is that, when Congress refuses to obey the will of the people because of special-interest campaign money, for instance, we have a recourse: Though difficult, we can initiate the process of calling a new constitutional convention to revise the Constitution, so that it is, once again, of, by, and for The People.",99

But the worst part is even with maximum tension applied, if you put a little bit of pressure on the gate, the whole thing slides back and forth. There is no way I am going to use this gate, it is completely unsafe and would fall onto my baby if she tried to pull up on it.

But this album is laced with unbelievable songs like, For heavens sake, itz yours, cash still rules, visions, as high as wu tang get, severe punishment, Unbelievable lyrics in a better tomorrow, triumph, MGM, hells wind staff, sick beat on impossible.

0,Protects screen but not click wheel area,I purchased this product soon after I bought my ipod. Had even left the annoying shrink wrap on until I had a proper case... The result? Two months of use and huge gouges in the face near the click wheel. Even upon slipping the ipod into the case the first time some scratching occured across the click wheel. The case fits much tighter on the lower half of the ipod with a gap between the face of the screen and the case. Through normal use the occasional piece of sand/pocket [...] worked its way into the case. Since there is no way to remove the ipod other than slipping it in and out I watched in horror as the scratches occurred in the process.Other negatives:-Case adds alot of width to the ipod-Opening in bottom not sufficient for connection to Belkin auto adapter.Solution:Use the Apple supplied case..you're much better off,149

In this you can do a wide range of things, from Crashes, Racing, Takedown, Head to Head etc. There are a lot of the crashing games in World tour so it can get a little bit annoying/boring.The only sad thing is that you can't do anything to the cars, can't tune it, can't pimp it although you can change the colour!! (How great is that?!) And it does take a long time to get into the game. I mean you start off with a pathetic car, and it isn't all that fun, but when you start unlocking things it suddenly becomes more interesting.It also comes equipped with ""Net Play"" (which although I haven't got, is extremely fun)Like I said BUY IT!!",185

1,beautful words,"This is my favorite cd of 2001. Yes the beat could have been different but the words are so beautiful and Christina's voice is very beautful, she sings in this album with a passion and she even wrote the words so of course I gave her all the stars that I could give her in this rating. I think that ""Just Be Free"" the song rather than the album of the same title was written when she was young and that the rest of the songs on the album were written in 2001. Since she's with a new record company after sueing her old record company she must have had a say wheter or not this album was released. She never had a cd released in fall of 2001 like she supposedly said that she would. ""Believe me"" is my favorite song on this cd. I'm probably your biggest male fan now. I'm 26 years old and I like this new style of yours much better than the old one. Christina you go girl !!!!",175

Even jokes that perhaps wouldn't work on other shows are pulled off through the delivery and the fact that they doesn't try too hard.

Mind I will read his work until his last book is published, but not with the same passion I once did. In Crossroads of Twilight, as in Winters Heart, the story seems to fade. It just seems that RJ is writing so that he can write another book. I won't give away plot or story line, but to say all the main players appear, though Rand isn't seen until three hundred pages in. Few questions are answered, though more are asked. And the end leaves you so twisted you feel like tossing the book across the room. With the probability that the next book won't come out till late 2005 this reader feels disheartened with ever seeing an end to what once was epic series with outstanding depth.

Beacuase of this they were forced to change their name to The Kovenant. After the name changed, unfortunately so did the bands sound. This not being a good change at all.

Sully could never come close to Layne, no one will ever and thats a given fact. Isn't Godsmack the track on Alice in Chain's album Dirt? Oh I'm sorry it was God Smack. Even if the band started as a AIC cover band it really makes me sick that they try to pose or atleast Sully after two albums.

She read the book in less than 2 afternoons/evenings, waiting for the story to strenthen... It never happened. Now she says she doesn't even care to see the movie. Wow...",73
0,didn't work for me - IBS,"Apparently the SCD diet is great for UC and Crohn's, but it did nothing for me. I've had IBS D for a long time, and though I stuck to this pretty religiously for about a month and a half, I saw no improvement. I may try it again after the holidays, but it seems that for most people, there is noticeable improvement immediately, so I got discouraged when I didn't see any.",72

1,The light at the end of a very long tunnel!,"I have been suffering with chronic fatigue for most of my life. 7 years ago we thought that we had found a medication that would work, but to my dismay stopped after about a year. It has been a very long battle ever since. I am a motivated person, but my illnesses always threw road blocks up on every path I tried to follow. I finally sunk into a desperate depression thinking that this is what life was going to be like for me. This book was a godsend, validating all of my feelings, concerns, worries, anxieties, aches and pains. And showing me that there is help available and life doesn't have to be this way. It is like the light at the end of a very long, dark tunnel!",130
0,Quite possibly your single biggest mistake in life!,Seagul doesn't live in reality. The most successful sites on the Web are successful because of their content. I wouldn't count any sites listed in this book as a true success. Successful sites get millions of hits each month NOT per year. Successful sites are generating millions in revenues.Sadly you are doing yourself a great disservice if you listen to any of the advice in this book. Instead of buying garbage. I recommend you get a well written book that focuses on content and design. Two of the best Web books available today are Weinman's Designing Web Graphics.2 and Stanek's Web Publishing Unleashed Professional. Both books are a much better investment of your time and money.,116
1,Very Nice Scanner,I'm surprised to hear that some people had negative comments about Pacific Image customer support. Their website offers updated downloads including a PDF of each model's manual. I have never had trouble with my scanner so I had no reason to contact customer support but if you are looking for a review of this product from someone who has used then I have to say it is one of the best scanners I have used. Check out Pacific Image's website [...] for more info on their scanners.,87

0,I did not find it simple and handy!,First of all this book is not simple at all. I was looking for something which is easy to use. These kinds of books should be easy reference points. It means whenever there is a need for a cure you should be able to look inside to find the problem from the list and the answer below it. In this book it is almost not possible to find out how to treat your complaint. The book is so complicated that I was lost in details that I do not need to know and no answer to my questions at the end!,101
1,Pride & Prejudice,"Pride & Prejudice is simply a great romantic movie. As a ""male"" movie viewerI was skeptical of the ability of this movie to draw me into it's story. My wife talked me into itand I am glad that I did. Terrific acting, interesting social predicaments ( Jane Austin truly chronicles the pitfals of an male dominated, upper class society),Wonderful music( I ended up getting the soundtrack) and scenery too.",69

1,Great escapism,"Not all books have to be plausible or loaded with heavy, hidden meaning, as some of the other reviewers indicate. I greatly enjoyed the story line, the characters, and the complexity of the situations Alex found himself in - not unlike problems most of us find ourselves in (at least to some degree, if not in Hollywood or on a national level). I was sorry to finish it; I also ordered the author's next novel.",75
0,Isn't working for my dog.,"Putting the bed together was ok. However, I found that the legs could shift when you pick up the bed from one side. We had gotten the bed because our dog kept digging to find a cooler place to lay. Our dog is about 70lbs and fit fine on the bed. He seemed to like it for a few days. Then he started tipping the bed up and digging underneath it. The hole got deep enough to where he could lay in the hole with the bed covering him for shade. Later he tipped the bed over and got his cable wrapped around it and somehow managed to pull the legs apart. So now we still have a hole in the yard and a bed in pieces.",127

1,Braun 5790 shaving system,"I replaced a Norelco rotary shaver with the Braun. I liked the idea of a shaver being cleaned, sanitized and charged after each shave so I bought the Braun. So far, it shaves much closer than my Norelco. The shaver is not quite as ""mobile"" as the Norelco due to its shape and it is noisier than my Norelco, but it is comfortable on my face and does a good job. The cleaning system works well but is also noisy for about 5 minutes. You do have to replace the cleaning fluid cartridge after every so many cleanings, but that doesn't entail a lot of money. All in all, I like the shaver and would buy it again. I do use a pre-shaving fluid on my face and it seems to help with the closeness of the shave.",138

0,Mathewson-Lite,"There is not enough baseball detail in what could have been an interesting book. Seib's efforts to set the career of BIG SIX in a broader context is laudable, but misses the point for a book this brief and this short. Some people devote their lives to the history of the world's greatest game. Seib is not one of them. The mechanics of his prose will not put you to sleep, but do not linger in the mind either. But the glaring error of this book is selling Christy short. Seib can bring himself to devote less than two pages to one of the greatest World Series performances in history, where Christy spun three shutouts. While some baseball books devolve into pitch-by-pitch tedium, more detail here is demanded.If there is a better Christy book out there I will consider reading it. Do not waste your time with this one.",149

These are good enough that I can read them repetedly and still experiance all the emotions I felt the first time through.Not only, but Izark the main guy is a georgious babe! and you cant help loving him, even if he seems gruff sometimes. Noriko, the main character is from modern day Asia and was blasted into this new mystical world. FULL OF HUNKS at every turn. And just you wait til she tries to learn the language later on. One pannel alone had me cracking up for ten minutes straight! The storyline is so much fun to walk through. And the author throws some completely random thoughts in every now and then which just makes me laugh all the harder. This book is worth every penny, and more.",160
0,I know 6th graders who can construct a better story.,"This novel doesn't even comes close to any previous Sheldon work. It is trite, the plot is non-existent, the characters are cardboard at best and say the stupidest things, and the whole thing is a huge waste of time. I gave it one star because that's as low as the ranking goes. For work of this caliber Amazon needs a line of minus stars.The sad part is this novel was most likely only published to trade on the previous well-done work by this author, and that is the only reason i read it.You know, there is much validity to the cliche ""quit while you are ahead"" and it is really a shame that Sheldon 's editor didn't remind him of that.",121
0,not good for legs,"I have waxed for ~15 years. I tried the laser hair removal, and it wasn't permanent, so now I'm back to finding a solution. I thought I'd try this because it was inexpensive, and I couldn't find the old one. It takes FOREVER to do my legs, and I have to go over it 3 or 4 times to get one hair. Maybe because my hair is so fine now from all the previous removal efforts? In any case, I'm now in the market for a different epilator and am looking at the ""Braun SE7781 Silk-Epil Xpressive Epilator Body System, Rechargeable"" which seems to get really good reviews.I gave this product two stars instead of one because it does work well under the arms. It's a small enough area that I can tolerate going over it 3-4 times and all the hair is gone. Definitely better than shaving or waxing (no more akward elbow-on-the-door-frame waxing tug of war with the underarms!) But if you're looking for one epilator to do it all, keep looking!",174
0,Well...,"I was kind of afraid to buy this after reading some of the comments. But it's not horrible, just unexceptional. There are about four good performances on the disc.

1,Great system,"This is a great navigation system. I decided on Garmin after a lot of research on the Web and speaking with other people who have GSP navigators. So far it has been very consistent in giving me good directions and it is very easy to use straight out of the box.The only thing it does not offer is ""highway only"" or ""no highways"" options on the routing. Also, it did not come loaded with the most current map software but Garmin is sending me the newest software at no charge.You won't find a perfect GPS in this price range but this one was close enough for me and so far I am very happy with it.",116

I can stand it until the baby's about 10 pounds, but after that, it's just plain painful.The pain starts in my shoulders, where the straps start to dig in. Then it moves to my lower back, which is straining to stay straight with 10+ pounds of baby pulling my upper back forward. Then my stomach muscles start to ache too.The only time i ever use this carrier is at the grocery story, where the fact that it is pretty easy to get set up solo is a major benefit. For walks at home when i can take the time to get the it set up, or any time i can borrow another pair of hands, i use theERGOcarrier, which keeps the weight on my hips instead of contorting my spine.",143

1,"Decent Park Tool, but I Don't like the Cap Tool","This tool works well to get the bottom bracket apart, but the plastic spindle remover does not provide enough surface to grab onto to remove stuck-on caps. Park Tool makes a metal tool for this also (BBT-10) that looks like a big wing nut. In hind sight I should have bought that as well. Most of the time those caps are stuck on there really tight. The BBT-10 would make it much easier to get the cap off. From personal experience, I highly recommend it in addition to this tool.",90

0,Disappointed,"I've been shaving electric since 1936!I have a light beard. My latest razors have been Norelcos and then almost ten years ago I bought a Braun 5520 and currently I use them alternately. I prefer the 5520 slightly over the Norelco because the cutters last much longer. I bought a Braun 8975 recently so I could leave it at my vacation house. It Seemed to have the same cutters as the series 7 w/o the questionable cleaning system.After 2 months I'm disappointed in the short usage time of the battery......I get 5 shaves only before I have to recharge and I've discharged it completely twice already.Also, it does not cut any closer than my 5520 which incidentally gives me about two weeks of shaving before I must recharge it. I'm sorry I got the 8975. It seems very cheaply constructed and a real disappointment. The case isn't very substantial either and it's very noisy.",154

On a trip this week, the 'button' which turned out to be a plastic rod which goes through the handle, and which secures the handle onto the shaft fell out and disappeared when I was breaking some rocks.I now have a hammer that tries to come apart when I hit a rock - horrible design! I guess I now have to find a steel rod to replace the plastic one - something Valley should have done in their original design!I think I'll stick with Estwing for my next hammer purchase!",125

1,is this zappa's best album?,"Maybe so. It is also probably his best band. FZ has often said that music shouldn't get in the way of good lyrics. He has also practiced (though not explicitly said) the opposite. This album is the exception. The two combine in a way rarely found: Humour and some of the most sophisticated music you're ever likely to hear come together here. I have a real problem if I have to compare this album to ""we're only in it for the money"" or ""200 Motels"" or ""Live in New York"", or ""Hot Rats"". But it may just be the best. I dicovered FZ through this album when I was 15. I have never looked back since.",116

I like how I can hook it up with a regulator to regulate the flow, but the trigger almost seems like it's either an on or off position. When you let the trigger go, it doesn't stop the flow immediately. You have to wait for a little trickle to come out. Too messy for me. It sure can burn through a tube of caulk in less than 30 seconds if you turn up the regulator.I wouldn't recommend it to anyone really. There are better products out there.",105

The sound quality of the DVD is terrible. You hardly can hear the dialog without turning up your center channel (If you want to hear the dialog at all). If you are looking for entertaining soft porn.

We'll just refer to a story, and she remembers the lesson. Not so with this one! I bought it in a Scholastic book order, and it'll be donated to my daughter's classroom tomorrow! Moral of the story: whine and drag your feet long enough, and you win! NOT a lesson I want to teach my own kids. I agree with other reviewers who said it just seems ""off"" from the other Bear classics, and it's probably better than 2-stars for just readability factor, but for what I was looking for (a book with a lesson taught, what I've come to expect from BB), it fell way too short of the mark.",169
1,Iron Man,Hey I like it and that's all your going to get unless you have to put in more words which is rediculous!,22
0,A Disgrace to the good name of Paramount and Demille!,"I saw this version, the remake, first, then the original. Ever since I saw the 1938 original I haven't been able to sit through this one. Compared to the '38, this one has NO adventure whatsoever. Clair Bloom is terrible, trying to be something she ain't. The story isn't completely told, missing a few vital scenes that are found in the original 1938 swashbuckler starring Frederic March and Franciska Gaal. If you've seen this, or want to my advice: watch the original instead, the original is a six star epic!",90
1,Emotional,Vikki Carr has one of the most beautiful voices. She brings something special to her latin music. Her style of clarity and emotion is truly moving!,26
1,Janis Joplin meets Aretha Franklin,"This is by far my favorite CD this year. I listen to it every time I'm in the car and then bring it into the house to listen to while I work out. The slower songs are endearing and the rest makes you proud to be a girl! I LOVE this CD. I bought it for LA Story because I liked it so much. However, when I've bought a CD because of one hit I am generally let down with the rest of the songs but not with this one. This is an AWESOME CD. Highly, HIGHLY recommended. Waiting for her to come in concert to the MN area - PLEASE BETH!",112
1,Simply fascinating,"I have read several books before regarding NDEs and the subject is always truly astounding. Moody gives examples from many different people who have experienced NDEs. This book makes a believer out of me that there is life after life on earth. Moody doesn't try to sell his viewpoint - he simply presents the facts as they were presented to him. He doesn't try to sell the phenomena as brains deprived of oxygen; he doesn't try to sell any scientific reasons as to what really happens. He lets the peoples stories speak for themselves. If you know someone who is a non-believer in the hereafter (and may be dying), this book should make them less afraid of death.",118
0,fan of john edward show not book,"i'm a fan of john edward and i watch as often as possible. he gives so much of himself to help others heal. i could not finish this book. i went half way and put it in my ""get around to it"" pile. john's gift is one on one interaction.",50
1,Does the job well,Much better than the wrist omron I purchased a while ago. This one is even used at a one of my dr's offices. I measured my blood pressure before going to dr and then compared to dr's count. Only off by one or two numbers which nurse says is normal.,50
0,Not up to her usual standards,"This is one big disappointment. There are simply too many negatives to this video--don't waste your money! I was surprised to find that this was so poorly done, compared to the 3 other Saffell videos I own and use regularly.The production is so poorly done, half the time you can't hear what she's saying. The volume and quality of her voice vary with her moves, so at times it's muffled. The lighting is awful and the camera changes angles so frequently it's impossible to see what they're doing, nevermind follow it. It looks very amateurish.Usually Janis gives too much instruction and too many demo's before picking up the pace. Here it's the opposite---we go right into complicated moves with little instruction and even less practice. So frustrating it's no fun.Janis is capable of much, much better than this.",138
1,Fabulous Read,"Fell in love with the country of Ecuador this year and then fell harder when I read this book...fabulous story, well written and incredibly irresistible!",25
0,CAN'T FIND A GOOD SLEEPING PILL? THAN BUY THIS MOVIE!,"Yes, I must admit that I was fooled by the ""One of the most notorious, most debated, most banned films of the 'video nasty' era."" line on this back of this movie case. I was lucky because I found this at a Best Buy for $10.99. It should be $2.99 for as bad as it is. I've been let down by these Italian Horror Films one too many times. If you want good, gore filled, Italian Horror stick with Lucio Fulci or Dario Argento. Once you get past the bad dubbing and acting they're berrible. Oh, by the way, unless you are fluent in Italian this second disk is almost worthless-there is no opportunity to even have English subtitles. The only thing good about the second disk is the nudity and strong sexual content and that looks alright in any language!",141

1,Fun album - not all tracks are appropriate for young children,"My daughter has been a big fan of Johnny Cash (loves his voice!) since infancy. I was delighted to see that he has a children's album.

I took away one star because it can be noisy.",63

1,Staying power through solid composition,Copeland's music is still fresh after almost fifteen years. I recommend this album to anyone with a taste for the nearly frenetic but carefully composed pieces once heard in the CBS series The Equalizer.I think you won't be disappointed.,39
1,Almost Perfect,"I imported this Soundtrack and was pleasantly surprised by just how much was covered and a little disappointed by what wasn't.This 32 Track CD will let you relive your favorite moments from this wonderful Series, however there are three things that keep this CD from getting five stars:#1: The Yozuca Track ""Going My Way"" is the short ""TV Size"" version (1:37) instead of the full version (4:27)#2: If you plan to put this CD on your iPod or any other mp3 player from your computer, you better be able to read japanese because good luck finding the english names of these tracks#3: For some reason, the track where Hayate and Kosame are first introduced, the track for which I bought this CD in the first place, is sadly absent. There is one that sounds sort of like it, but it's just not the same.But most people can live with these minor blemishes on what is one of the greatest Anime Soundtracks available (if you can stomach the crazy importing costs).",170
1,One of my favorites,I really enjoyed these CDs. I got a lot out of this series and am now listening to them for a 2nd time. One of my favorites.,27
0,Disappointed by bias,"I found this book somewhat useful, in that it has a run down of development milestones which is what I was after in reading it, but overall disappointing.The fact that Barker says it is fine to stop breastfeeding at 9 months if you want to, despite that fact that Australian, American and the World Health Organisation's standards all recommend breasfeeding until *at least* 12 months concerned me. While there are acceptable alternatives for those who cannot breastfeed for whatever reason, her 'expert' view that to stop at 9 months is 'fine' seems misleading.Additionally, although she presents various options for managing issues such as night waking, it is clear where her bias lies (controlled crying) and she does not present any of the advantages of other systems.Basically, this book presents itself as being balanced and giving you options, but in my opinion the 'balance' is very one sided.I will not be purchasing or recommending this book.",155
1,An ABSOLUTE Must Have!!!!,"Every song on this CD is wonderfully crafted and if you like the samples, you will LOVE the CD! The full CD is so much better than the samples. I was a bit skeptical of buying the CD by just the samples but let me tell you - WELL worth the money!!!",52
1,Dir en grey!,It's a single but it's got some pretty cool live tracks on it. I don't think i've seen these tracks on any of the other releases i own so definitely worth scooping up if you're a fan. If not this is still one of the more accessible places to start in their catalog.,53
1,Solid chair,"Good, sturdily constructed chair was easy to assemble. Comfortable seat and mesh backrest make for hours of sitting pleasure. Armrests are a little plasticy and cheap but not a major drawback. Overall, quite pleased.",34
1,Al Rokers cookbook,"One of my pts wanted this book, said she was having a hard time finding it. I bought it for her and she was so excited Loves the book Thank you for having it available and rec'd in a short time",41
0,Not worth much,"Quotes aren't very inspirational or original and some don't even seem very related to Teddy Bears. Also, most are from people I've never heard of, which takes something away from them. The pictures aren't generally related to the quotes, and the book isn't as nice and ""miniature"" as I was hoping. Overall, not my best purchase... That said, it was cheap.",61
1,Beautiful!,This is just beautiful music--very melodious and evocative. Yo-Yo Ma is a consummate musician. Wonderful compositions like Morricone's in his hands is a delight to the ears and emotions. I highly recommend this CD.,34
1,a captivating story,"I loved this movie! Being set in Savannah, Ga. it was great to be able to recognize many of the sites. Kevin Spacey was outstanding as usual. This is a ""must-see"" for any Spacey fan or those who love a good mystery--and it just happens to be a true story, making it all the more intriguing.",56
0,there are better books than this.,"Lots of girls at my school reads the gossip girl series.So, I decided to read the first book. Yet.. it was so menial compared to other books that I've read. I understand why it has other people my age who normally don't read for fun, reading it. That's a good thing. But it's like a tv show like the O.C. or something on paper. It has no lasting meaning behind it.The plot is basically :A bunch of rich people going to parties, being nasty to each, wearing expensive clothes and (what do you know..) gossiping.Mildly entertaining. But if I wanted that I could just as easily watch TV or see a movie, a bad movie.This is a good book for people who don't like to read as it isn't challenging in the least or if you just like this kind of story.But if you're looking for a book that you'll really enjoy and remember, this isn't it.",157
1,Wow.,"I can't say much about this cd that hasnt already been said below. I just had to put this review here because of how impressed I was with this album. I have never heard a live album better than this in performance and production. The songs may sometimes lose those intracicies in the guitar parts and vocal harmonies that the studio versions had... but what it gains is so much more than I ever could have imagined from this band. Fantastically intense and atmospheric... probably the best progressive power metal album I have ever heard. Some of you guys may beg to differ, but I'm standing firm on this.",109
1,Steelers NFL body pillow,"I was very pleased with the Steelers body pillow that I purchased from Amazon, I had been looking for this pillow for a couple years and was so pleased to find it. It came in plenty of time for Christmas and the price was reasonable. I would not hesitate to order from Amazon and this dealer again.",57
1,Great,This product is perfect for what it can do and for the price. This is why I gave it 5 stars.This is a great series and it just shows how some real black familes are.,35
1,His best and most revealing work,Stuart Wilde lays it all out. If you have not read any of his other work I suggest you do so BEFORE reading God's Gladiators. Everything Stuart has written is worth a read but God's Gladiators supasses anything he has done beofre. He pushes your limits as he pushed his own. I highly recommend any of his work.,58
1,Sound better than expected. Recommended if you are over 30.,"My 25 yr old son had a 500 watts MTX amp driving a 12 inch Solo Baric subwoofer in his Camero so I really do appreciate good bass. I managed to install this mini sub right behind the driver seat in my 2000 Corvette so I had zero loss of trunk space. The sub hits harder than expected but sounded slightly boomy and harsh at high volume compared to my son's system. I suspect the 75 watts amp is underpowered. Kenwood advertises this sub as 150 watts but that's peak or maximum power and not RMS power. At medium volumes (which most people over thirty listens to), it sounds great so this sub will compliment any system. In my opinion, if you need the trunk space and you are over 30, then you will like this sub. Be aware that the location of the sub must be close to you to be effective. I once located the sub in my trunk and the bass drops off significantly.",167
0,One good concept and a lot of BLA BLA,"Reader be advised that the author owns a consulting firm that applies Woody's proprietary model in making market forecasts and, needless to say, he's not giving out anything ...Interestingly enough, the author criticizes the use of quantitative models, but later attempts to measure the ""mood"" of the market to use it in a quantitative model ... ? One more comment: the average reader of business publications expects to find some logic in the style; this is not fiction, and using a ""keep the reader guessing what the author REALLY means"" is no business reading.Did you take English 101 like the rest of us?",103
1,Awesome!!!,"My sweet husband purchased the Kindle 2 for me as a Mother's Day gift. I absolutely love it. I have been able to access the Kindle store anywhere I have been and if I finish a series book, I can just access the store and within minutes I have the next book.Another thing that may not mean much to others but having the privacy to read anything and not have others checking out a book you have in your hands, is great to me. I love the freedom of the Kindle. It fits in my purse and I can read it anywhere. I absolutely recommend it.",106
1,WHY only 4 stars ?,"OK,I will tell you. it is because, for me ,Edu singing some of his finest songs ""em Ingles"" is like putting catsup on a FILET<that's why! hahaha! I understand the reasons for this , believe me, but this is no rational to do such a ""HEINOUS THING"", seu Edu! Of course, there is enough GREAT stuff on this cd to warrant it's purchase, You may LIKE the English lyrics too! Anyway, the musical ""guidance"" of Hermeto Pascoal in conjuntion w/ Edu's strong compositional concept makes this a great jump off point to further explore the musics of EDU LOBO--- my suggestion ,FIND ""Cantinga de Longe"",This is ""the one"",but enjoy this just the same ! Sarava Edu Ok,here's your 5th star--hahaha!",120
1,not bad...,"Every 'suspense thriller' that comes out these days has a huge obstacle to overcome: the obligitory comparison to 'SILENCE OF THE LAMBS', or 'SEVEN'. How can ANY movie of such type hope to compete with these shining achievements of genre filmmaking? The answer is , of course, that they can't. 'TAKING LIVES' however, is at least a solid thriller that held my interest throughout. Ethan Hawke playing against type was a nice change of pace, and the lovely Angelina Jolie is always a welcome addition to any production. She may be mailing in on this role, but the woman is a vision to behold. Bottom line: I was entertained. Check it out.",112
1,A delightful read to escape the holiday stress!,"I have read all of John Grisham's books and have enjoyed his writing, though I had grown tired of the ""lawyer theme."" A Painted House was a nice change; but this one brings out what I think is a rare talent -- writing humor. I laughed out loud through this whole book. My husband kept sticking his head in the room to say, ""I must ask Grisham to write more books like this!"" It was a delightful weekend read and one that restored my spirit and still has me chuckling as I think about all the predicaments Luther created for himself. It is funny and heartwarming and strikes close to the truth of many of the traditions we have all established. When things get too frantic this season, take a few minutes to pick up this book and laugh long and loud!",142

1,The voice of an angel(no doubt about it!),"Angela Bofill's debut album. This is still as wonderful, amazing and unforgettable as it was when originally released in 1978.A truly wonderful and timeless album which features ""Under The Moon And Over The Sky"" ""This Time I'll Be Sweeter "" and ""Summer Days"". If you are into good music you MUST have this album. Just one listen and you will know why Angela has an angel's voice!",67
0,One Love ~ 8th World Wonder,"If you want music that puts you to sleep, this is the album for you! What a shame, the third runner-up in the American Idol 2 series has a debut album in which her highly synthesized voice sounds like a combination of Hillary Duff, Britney Spears and Monica. The problem is, the producers couldn't make up their minds which one she should imitate! All the songs sound alike-with no beginning and no end and Kimberley just drones on and on about l.o.v.e. I didn't even enjoy listening to her duet with the other AI finalist. Hopefully, her next album will showcase her true voice instead of masking it.",108
1,Millenium Soul,"Love in Stereo might be ideal for that ""put-on-a-hot-soul-track-and-she's-mine"" ploy, but Rahsaan Patterson is one artist to eschew the hot 'n' sweaty sexual soundtrack trivialization of soul, and give it back some of its original features. A closer listen and a look at the video ""Treat You Like a Queen"" reveal his interest in issues of human rights. His activities for the National Association of Abused Women and Children, as well as his non-profit organization ""Soul Survivors"" put his money where his music is, smack bang in the Harlem neighbourhood where he grew up. Musically Patterson's sound resembles the laid-back but intense atmosphere of '70s Stevie Wonder records with a tendency, especially in the second half of the album, to gear up to funk and swing. Remarkable also is the cover of The Blow Monkey's '80s hit ""Diggin' Your Scene"" on the Japanese edition. By the way Rahsaan celebrated his 27th birthday on January the 1st, 2000.",157
1,Fits great. Happy with it!,"This took a little over a week to receive, but worth the wait. After reading the other reviews, I wondered if it would fit our iron-board, which we've had for almost 20years. No worries though! It fit perfect, like a glove. It even had two riveted holes at the base to 'hook' onto 2 small pegs under the board (I didn't even know they were there). It's nicely padded, but still folds up easily. Very pleased with this purchase.",79

1,'Untergang' discussed,"Written in the era of the postmodernist attack on science, and one of the few books in English (?) that discusses Spengler's 'Decline of the West'. Noteworthy for that alone, if you're one of the few who's read at least some chapters of Spengler. I found the discussion of Mach's Principle in the context of 'holism' to be scientifically enlightening and useful. It's good to learn to distinguish the relativity principle from 'relativism'. Mach had no idea of the difference.",80

1,"Good for Some, Unnecessary for Most","There are several Rush compilations, and this is not the best but will work well for some. At sixteen cuts and just under eighty minutes, it has songs from every Rush album through 1987 except Caress of Steel. Virtually every Rush song heard on radio is here, and anyone wanting only those will be satisfied. However, Rush is a true album band; deep cuts are often as good as or better than singles, and albums usually work better as a whole. This collection is thus only for extreme casuals. Anyone who is even slightly more curious would be better off with Rush's half dozen or so best albums. There is also no reason for completists to get this; it has nothing new. All this points to the fact that The Spirit was a record company marketing ploy to coincide with Rush's thirtieth anniversary, which is all that need be said.",150
1,Healthy for Hair and Environment,"I first received this shampoo as part of a gift. With all the chemicals we are exposing ourselves and the environment to, it was nice to find a shampoo that leaves everyone healthier. It has a great smell and leaves my hair shiny and clean. It does suds up but not as fluffy as other shampoos and some people may expect lots of suds. Since my only concern is clean hair without chemicals it didn't bother me. I highly recommend this product and feel safe using it on my family.",90

0,Disappointing,"I have spent the last three days trying to program this phone and it just gets more and more exasperating. There are 30 buttons on a 4 1/2 by 4 1/2 inch area and if you touch the wrong button, it is either erasing the information just entered, changing the settings, or recording phone conversations or ambiant noise. The read out is hard to see and it has only recorded one caller ID and now that functon has stopped. My other phone with caller ID is still recording the information so I know there is nothing wrong with my phone service. Yesterday it started blocking all outgoing calls altho I can still get incoming calls, I don't have a clue what is going on with this phone. In the past 10 years I have purchased well over 500 items from Amazon and this is the first time I have ever had any kind of problem.

Prime example: Holly, trapped in a frozen part of the Land of the Lost, complains repeatedly about how cold she is, but she never even rolls down her sleeves! I also disliked the sudden frequency of visitors to the Land in Season 3.It's a shame that the series underwent such radical changes; it would have been much more interesting to see the series develop on its original trajectory.",108

1,Old Pentax lenses can be used with this camera,"I made the decision a few months ago that the time was right to buy a digital SLR. I considered a number of models. What sold me on this one was that I am able to use my very old, but very good, lenses. [...]I had 4 Pentax ME Super bodies from the 1980's. My lenses also date from that time.The manual was not very helpful in figuring this out. It does require a setting change and one can shoot in only manual focus mode with aperture priority. It's very much like shooting with the old ME's but with a 6.3 megapixel digital image as the result.From the menu, go to ""Custom Setting,"" scroll down to ""Using aperture ring,"" set to ""Permitted.""",122

0,There's no Secret here,"As I read The Secret, I couldn't believe that the professional who recommended it to me embraces the nonsense this book spews out. Turns out, she doesn't - I ordered the wrong book. I read the first four or five chapters, and was stunned that anyone could seriously entertain most of what the authors wrote. They do touch on some long-held beliefs shared by people throughout the ages, but they have an ability to turn such nuggets of truth into a life view that embraces the pursuit of wealth and fame. And you can have it, too - just follow the law of attraction! After reading the biographies of the various contributors, it is obvious that the book is a painfully thin-veiled advertisement for the workshops, books, and programs they are hawking. I'm very surprised well-known, otherwise fairly wise people didn't see that coming from the start.",147

0,Jarmusch continues to diminish his legend,"If you thought ""Ghost Dog"" was as bad as it could get, you were mistaken. This ""film"" would get a failing grade if submitted by an 18 year old at NYU film school. Everyone involved in making this boring, shoddily acted and directed travesty needs to be slapped. Perhaps a few critics who breathe a more rarifed air, or have evolved beyond requiring the burdens of plot, quality of acting, script, or basic direction, will find this celluloid atrocity entertaining. They should be slapped too. And slapped again.The stink of this film will linger long after you flush it from your DVD player. Even Bill Murray could not save it, but I could never find it within my heart to slap Bill.Jarmusch can only redeem himself now by perhaps saving a busload of children, and dying in the process.Perhaps.",139

The premise is interesting as you don't find a lot of writers who are sympathetic to Demons. But I found it hard to reconcile that Jacob, the Enforcer, who has had centuries to hone his skills, had to rely on Isabella to save him not once but a few times. I don't like stories where skills appear without having been earned. For more than half the book, the story barely, moves with all the characters being angsty about what's going on in their culture. The sex descriptions are good (although he can't seem to get his fingers untangled from her hair!).

I'd compare having to sit through this movie to having to sit through Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome, but this experience might have been worse.

Because of this I didn't feel comfortable hanging it directly under the shower head by the rope, so I used the suction cups and placed it at the far end of the shower. But, I was constantly afraid that the suction cups would fail and the radio would fall. I used it exactly TWICE (total time was about 30 minutes) when the volume (on/off) button broke. Thankfully I still had the packaging but I had to pull it out of the trash can to return this thing. Think I'm going to try to find a different shower radio.",124

Also there are times when an author can believably write from the other gender's perspective and get it right, unfortunately this was not the case here. It was pretty obvious that the author was a male, not in tune with what a 30+ female thinks, feels, admires etc.The most disappointing thing was the ending. In all honesty, ""Bones Become Flowers"" was a waste of money.",101

1,Anything But Sour,"A WONDERFUL lost, (at least to me) Christmas movie that will now be firmly established on my list of must see Holiday films.I had not seen this film before and did not know it was a Christmas film (probably because of the title) but it is a warm and hilarious Bob Hope romp and a veritable who's who of great character actors including Lloyd Nolan, Fred Clark, Sid Melton, Jay C. Flippen, Jane Darwell (the Feed The Bird's Lady from Mary Poppins), Tor Johnson (the hulking giant from Plan 9 From Outer Space) and even dear old Fred Mertz or William Frawley who helps introduce the old holiday standard ""Silver Bells"". And that's just the tip of the iceberg!The writing is great. The direction top notch and the laughs just keep on coming. I suggest you put ""The Lemon Drop Kid"" right at the top of your holiday film list. And why wait until Christmas?

It's obvious that the script writers, actors and director have a psychological issue with how they've spent their lives in Hollywood boutiques and are overcompensating by creating toughness the easiest way they know how - let's talk tough. Besides the totally, totally unbelievable tough guy/woman acting was the single day rental fee for a helicopter and some industrial warehouse basement to provide the obligatory concrete passages and steam piping. The story was nothing more creative than the time worn plot of the military hiding an alien or devil or whatever.

0,An Unanswered Question,"The movie is based on one question: ""What if the saga of Jesus happened today?"". The problem is, the question is never answered. What this film is, is simply a modern day re-telling of the saga of Jesus. It is too literal an interpretation. The 12 desciples are still all men. They are all named the same as the original 12. ""Jesse"" (why not Joshua???), as the savior is called, feeds the hungry with bread instead of something modern like pizza. Jesse is executed on the cross instead of by lethal injection or some other modern method.Although most of the story was a bit judgmental and anti-semitic in some aspects, the special effects were good and the crusifixion scene was intense and very dramatic.",124

For $30.00(plus this item did not have free shipping) you get a plastic mat that has two sides, a plastic barre, and an instructional video, and ballet slippers that barely fit. The video uses song and a kind of techno sounding beat to try to teach the steps. My daugter was a bit confused when she used this. It was like a game of twister for her. She wasn't sure where to put her feet and at times and needed encouragement from me to help her place her feet. It says you can combine the foot moves to make a dance. If my daughter cannot figure out where to put her feet how is she going to do that? The money would have been better spent on real ballet lessons with a real instructor.

The book is more a follow-up to the story, rather than a retelling or a sequel, but it does give you the entire story covered in the documentary. Besides providing us with some very interesting insights into the lives of the celebrities in her life, both well-known and obscure, Ms. Cross tells a fascinating story of identity and family relationships, with no easy answers, and I'd call it a very good read. I do hope Ms. Cross has in reality come to terms with the circumstances of her life as well as this book indicates that she has.",114
1,"Very good, but a little fast for beginners.","It's a good video, in my opinion.

1,Review of Civilisation ma mere!,"I am also reading this book for my French class. I found it a thoroughly enjoyable read.

0,Unique artist,"At the time I purchased this CD, I did not know much about Brahms or Schumann. After listening to this CD of the Brahms and Schumann Violin concerto and comparing it with other big name violinists, you can see that the quality of this violinist is nowhere near the greats, such as Perlman or Gil Shaham.The Japanese violinist in this album is unique in that he is blind. I found that to be really unique and inspiring for a classical musician. However, there are parts in this album where he is a little out of tune and the runs are not completely clean. Having said that, I would avoid purchasing this album.",112
1,"Nice handheld shower, a little more flexible would be better","Kids love this. I personally felt the tube could have been a little more flexible. It was stiff after few days of use. Connecting was easy, and the number of flexible settings is definitely good. No leaks. Packaging was a real pain to open, needed a scissor and a sharp paper cutter to open it. Why do the packages so hard. I wish this had come in Amazon frustration free packaging.",71
1,Better Earl Grey (Decaf) than Bigelow,"I compared the reviews for all of the Earl Grey teas on Amazon, and the reviews said Bigelow (Decaf) was better than Twinings and Stash, so I purchased it. I also purchased Choice Organic (Decaf) at the same time.I have been comparing the two, and I find that Choice Organic is actually stronger per bag and tastes better. Even though it is in bags, it almost is as good as loose leaf. It is a little higher in price, but it seems like it is good quality. They must've changed the formula since skacleve's review in 2009 below, though not sure.",101

1,wow,"Although I knew this would be a very hard book to read, I found myself not able to put it down. As a native of Florence & a Clemson student, the book more than intrigued me. Although I'm sure some stuff had to be exaggerated, I thought this was an amazing expose of the nature of some Greek organizations... one that most people don't want to talk about at all. I'm terribly sorry that this happened to the author, but I'm glad that he's able to put everything into words & hopefully help others.For any of you considering coming to Clemson, please know that his experience was far from the norm. I have found that my years there have been some of the most wonderful in my life. I have found a wonderful, embracing community, & I hope that others can find that too, wherever they go!",147

0,Agenda pushing and altogether not interesting,"First, this book definitely has an agenda to push. It's not balanced look at the New Deal, the people behind it and what it did do right. It's an attack on FDR. Political, self-serving books that pose as history lessons are bad to begin with.But that aside, I jsut found this book to not be alltogether that well written. It went on and on at times, citing endless research, but never striving to drive the point home. Instead it wanted to point out problems in the New Deal using numbers and statistics that have been debated over and over.",99
1,Fox really dropped the ball,"I happened to be home friday night and saw the first airing of this show. It was great! It had been a while since I laughed so much at a show and I watched it the following weeks as well. Then I discovered Fox had dropped the show. What were they thinking? Fox it seems, is too caught up on instant ratings. A lot of good shows need to grow their fan base. Unfortunetly, this show didn't even have time to do that. If I was over the exec. that decided to drop this show I would have had him fired! Great show, I'm buying the DVD to see the other 9 episodes that didn't air and hopefully they will be just as great! To bad another network didn't see the potential and pick it up.",136

0,Science fiction hiding in Star Wars clothing,"I must say that this book was a disappointment to me. The story wasn't bad, and Greg Bear is an above average sci-fi writer. But take out the words Jedi Knight and change the main characters' names and you will see the book has little to do with the Star Wars universe and the characters who populate it. If anything, Bear writing seems contained because he is trying to make it fit into the Star Wars mold.Not bad sci-fi, but not a good Star Wars tale.",86
0,What the ????????,"This is what passes for humorous writing these days? Pollack has some cleverness--but not much else. He's a poseur, and his pose isn't even original. The only way to entertain yourself while reading this tedious and pretentious little book is to ask yourself, ""Who is he trying to imitate in this piece?"" Pollack is so unfunny that he makes Dave Barry look like S. J. Perelman. Pollack is is a run-of-the-mill McSweeney's narcissist. That he has fans--that people show up for his readings with intentions other than those of heckling him or shouting him down--is a distressing indication of how stupid the ""hipster"" reading public has become. The McSweeney's publishing operation is little more than a vanity-press outfit.",118

0,"Decent, but could be much better","The plot is pretty good and I like the quick pace. BUT... the typographical errors and confusing dialogue are enough to drive a person insane! Lines are occasionally ended in mid-sentence only to begin again in a new paragraph. Several times, the wrong term is used (example: ""poll"" instead of ""pole""). Quotations marks are often in the wrong place or missing all together. And speaking of the dialogue, it's very hard to figure out who is saying what half the time because the conversation is lumped into a paragraph instead of being seperated by who is speaking. What this book needs is a good proofreader!...",105

The movie paid hommage to the original movie. The only odd thing I found was that The Secretary of Defense (Kathy Bates) was the most senior government leader you see during the entire movie. Considering this is an event affecting the entire world, it seemed a little odd. Overall, a good watch for any science fiction enthusiasts.",83

You can cook on a low temperature with a 1/2"" of oil or butter in the bottom of the frying pans, and yet food still sticks! You may be able to saute some veggies in oil, but forget browning potatoes (they will end up mashed), and don't even try eggs... they are a disaster. I don't want to be an ""artist"", I just want some hot food that I don't have to chisel off the bottom of my pots and pans.Even if you are merely boiling water for mac-n-cheese with the small pots, you better be stirring CONSTANTLY. The noodles in contact with the bottom of the pot will stick fast.There is a reason Teflon was invented. If you like to chisel food off the bottom of your pans when cooking or washing, get these. If you want no-stick, avoid. My $20 Coleman camping cook set does a better job than these.",175

1,"This is the BOOK, not the Movie/DVD !!!!","I'm not sure how so many reviewers managed to mix up the two . . . anyway, the nature and tone of the book are vastly different (and in my mind, much more entertaining) than that of the movie. Winston Groom's ""Gump"" is filled with side-splitting ironic humor, as well as an healthy skepticism of the various powers that be that the protagonist encounters. My guess is that people who saw the movie first will be disappointed by the lack of sentimentality in the book - but if you are one of the handfull of people remaining on the planet who have not seen the movie, PLEASE read the book first - it's hilarious and life-affirming, without falling into the maudlin trappings that (at least in my mind) diminished the movie.",131

Unsurprisingly, I purchased another Titanium.Unfortunately, I was punished for my loyalty.While I can't comment on the supplementary pieces as I don't use them, the unit itself saw more metal components substituted with plastic; the cord length was halved; and the motor appeared weaker or blades were/went dull (stalls frequently when cutting my hair.) Forget salon quality ... these clippers are not even suited for casual home use.I'm sure the executives behind these 'quality' choices are enjoying their bonuses. I, on the other hand, am disappointed with their product and will avoid buying a Remington -- of any sort - in the future.",137

If you ask me, if you go off and sell yourself to the Imperial Navy (the ""empiret"") then why would the League want to hire someone who has sold themselves to the otherside repeatedly.My other complaint is the lack of connection with the last game. If you haven't played or completed Colony Wars: Vengence skip this paragraph. If I understood the ending (the only REAL ending of Vengence) then there was something of a peace between the League and the Navy, yet from the very beginning that wasn't there. What happened?This game was a disappointment after Colony Wars and Vengence. *sigh*",131
1,Excellent Australian TV miniseries,"Six young Australian soldiers are captured by the Japanese and interred in Changi prison camp. Each of the six 1-hour episodes covers one man's recollections, as they meet for their last reunion. Each of the 12 principal actors is very good (six as the young soldiers and six as their older counterparts). This is the kind of engrossing story that you'll never see on American TV. The violence of their captors is quite graphic, but the humor they use to survive offsets it nicely. I highly recommend it.",88

Even so, the use of MATLAB glossarys is good and the inclsuion of various M-Files with the CD is a good idea. But what ever possesed the publisher to create the book solely on CD ! This is a terrible format to produce books in - i had to spend 3 days by the printer waiting for the chapers to come out - the additional expense that was incurred by me enraged me ! A collection of PDF files on CD ROM should not cost 25 dollars ! for this price i would expect a text book as well as the cd rom - if this is the trend that will be picked up by publisher then we are all in for some rough times ahead !",183

I want everyone I know to read this book because it has impacted me so much and I want them to be a part of that!Whether birth is your passion or you would just like to know a bit more about it, this book is a great read! I recommend it to everyone! It is also a great gift idea for expecting parents.",137
1,pleased,"I have just started crocheting with wire and out of the approximately 10 books I have collected, this one is my favorite. It has good information in it along with helpful directions. The pictures of the jewelry and baskets are beautiful. I like the projects because they are different without being something too over-the-top for the average person to actually wear.",61
1,GREAT TRUE STORY,THIS IS A REAL EYE OPENER ON HOW AA WAS STARTED. YOU'LL LEARN SO MUCH ABOUT THIS TERRIBLE DISEASE AND YOU'LL COME AWAY HAVING SO MUCH MORE COMPASSION FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM IT.

1,quick and easy,"Bought this product to fill some small crevices around my wood burning fireplaces that were bothering me. I was worried sparks could get in the cracks and cause problems. This product was easy to use and works very well. The gray is kind of dark. I was actually looking for a lighter gray, but it still looks fine.",58
0,Bad buy for the price!,"I was really excited to receive the Bushnell Instant Replay as a birthday present. However, I quickly learned that it's an incredibly difficult binocular to operate. First of all, I had trouble opening the battery compartment cover. I had to pry it out with a knife after many unsuccessful attempts. Then I had a hard time installing the Flash Memory card. The instruction booklet was terrible and did not mention the right way to instal it. I installed it the wrong way and it got jammed so I had to pry it out with a pair of pliers!! After doing all that, I got the camera to work. Then I decided I had to instal the software - the driver and the Photosuite. The driver was installed easily. Not so the Photosuite. After three attempts, the icon did not appear nor did it appear on Programs. I'm returning the camera!",150
1,WE'RE GONNA WALK ALL OVER YOU!!!,"First off, let me state that I am in no way, shape, or form, ""old-school."" I was about eight years old when this album came out. Luckily, I had older relatives who turned me on to these types of bands, and I'm very thankful they did. That being said, this album is classic from start to finish. If you are new to Overkill, this is a good start (By the way, you also can't go wrong with their debut ""Feel the Fire,"" but I digress...). This band has a huge catalog of music which will most definitely not disappoint. Also, if you find you like this album, you might want to check out a film that was put out by Rat Skates (Overkill's original drummer) entitledBorn in The Basement. It is an outstanding film that covers not only the formation of Overkill, but also how Rat epitomized the ""DIY"" philosophy; whether it be the stage layout or promotion. That being said, THRASH OR BE THRASHED!!!",165
0,Too much static electricity,This Mason Pearson brush has so much static electricity it renders it impossible to use. I don't know if it's an issue with the nylon or an issue with all their brushes.,32
0,Don't bother with this microscope,"Bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas and am VERY disappointed. I didn't expect a ""real"" microscope, but this one is made from flimsy plastic and won't hold focus at all, no matter how hard you try. If you want a microscope that is junk, you can get one for $15.00 - not $60.00. Wish I could get my money back! My granddaughter doesn't like it either; she's 11 years old and a science buff - she has no interest in it because she can't see anything. You might as well throw $60.00 out your car window.",97

While on the road the boys are messing with some people on their radio, using the code name Candy Cane. Well they ""run into"" Rusty Nail on the frequency and tell him to meet them obviously leaving him a false location. Rusty Nail seems to have a bad attitude about the whole trick and an innocent man ends up dead. On the road the next day the boys run into Rusty Nail again.....will they escape??? Watch this Thriller for a scary suprise ending that will make you think twice the next time you want to set out on a pleasant Joy Ride.",127
0,I don't like this!,"I was trying to replace a peel off mask I had in college over 10 yrs ago but couldn't remember the name; it left my face soft and it was easy to peel off and it didnt have a strong smell, but this product is the opposite. This product is messy to apply and thick, and it takes a long time to dry and I don't see a difference in my face when I take it off. I left it in the draw with all the other products I don't really use because they do nothing special. I mean really!!!",100
1,"Megadeth's ""Tattoo You""","This will probably go down as one of Megadeth's five best albums. It's everything a Megadeth fan craves, especially after Dave and Co. experimented with their distinctive sound for several records. This is mostly back-to-basics thrash by any definition.Megadeth's career arc reminds me a lot of the Rolling Stones: A legendary early batch of albums, then several years of allowing certain musical trends to influence their songs. The Stones finally went back to their roots with ""Tattoo You"" and basically said, ""This is who we really are."" ""The System Has Failed"" is that kind of record. Rock solid, honest, and thoroughly enjoyable.",102

1,Wonderful childbirth stories,"The stories in this book, of natural childbirth, are truly wonderful. The book focuses on the circumstances, the experience, the miracle of each birth, even the ones that didn't proceed textbook-perfect. These stories are touching, and heartening for someone who's lost faith in our healthcare system.",46
1,Good product,"Good price since I didn't have to go to the store for it but the cost is comparable to most stores. But fresh and quality the same as that in the store. I do a lot of gluten free and pale cooking. This is great product.,",46
0,IT WAS A BORING AND DULL BOOK!,It was not very intersting at all . A five year old could read it and it would be boring to them. Instead of having it recommended for 7th graders it should be for a 5th grader. We are to advansed for that book.,44
0,The star is for the book not stories,"First there is little explaination these are RE-printed stories from other books and mags. Second I still have not stumbled on the Marion Zimmer Bradley story, a primary reason for getting this book. At least the price came down and most tales are good if you have not already read them else where.",53
1,Moneyball is great!,"I love baseball and generally love movies about baseball. This movie is a slightly different twist on the usual ""bad team comes back to win"" theme. I was intrigued by the forward thinking of the general manager in the movie and absolutely loved this movie. I generally don't buy a movie unless it's one that I really love--and Moneyball is one of those.",63

1,Was a great bread and buy -- for four months,"I liked the GF Pantry bread mix so well I signed up to have automatic deliveries. Unfortunately, after my initial purchase, I only received one additional shipment before the offer was discontinued and the price of the product went up considerably! I liked this brand because it has reasonably good texture and taste (compared with regular bread) and for a gluten-free it required minimal additional (and less costly) ingredients compared to other mixes I've tried. For now, I'm experiencing with other GF bread mixes I hadn't tried earlier and am leaning towards ""Pamela's."" One other note on the ""Pantry's"" mix, IMO the bread's texture is better and it freezes better if it isn't cooked as long as directed.",118
0,Overrated mess,"Other than a couple of killer tracks, this CD is pretty repetitious and boring when you really listen to it. 'Illin' in Heaven' is a total waste of disc space (the 'F' word repeated ad naseum - how deep), plus 'Praise You' sounds an awful lot like 'Unbelievable' by EMF. The Housemartins (Cook's band from the 80's) simply blow this mess away. No they weren't dance pop, but they had far more depth and variety than found on this limp CD.",81
1,Nice pump,"This pump really works for me. I work part-time, and have to pump on other occasions too, and it works well. I can usually do both sides in about 20 minutes all together. It really helps the milk let down, and gets it at a fast pace. At first, it may seem a little too strong for suction, but you get used to it. It feels a lot better than the Single Deluxe electric pump. The breast shield is also very comfortable.",82
1,Some of the best love poetry ever written,"Elizabeth Barrett Browning's poetry, especially the ""Sonnets from the Portuguese,"" is beautiful, intelligent, and honest love poetry.

0,Buy Something Else,"The quality control on this product is poor (Pyle Pro PYLPDWM2700 Dual Channel 2 Wireless Mic). The first one I ordered had a intermittent handheld microphone (move it a certain way and it would loose battery power). I sent the whole set back and the second set had an intermittent channel in the wireless receiver which would randomly start making noise on its own and then saturate the signal to full volume. This was without a wireless transmitter even turned on. I sent it back and didn't want to try a 3rd.Also, the plug used for the wireless headset is unique to this brand and would limit the ability to replace just the headset if needed.Yes it's cheap for what it might deliver, but the hassle of trying new units to find a set that would work is not worth it. Spend more and get a better product.",148
0,A Groan Thing,We saw the trailer for this movie on another DVD rental and it looked like it was going to be a great comedy. Unfortunately the trailer contains all of the laughs. The guy who edited the trailer deserves an Oscar and then be shot. We wanted to like this one. We tried twice make it through the whole movie and couldn't make it either time. It was that bad. No it was worse. The lead actor is so over the top and stupid that he rendered the movie unwatchable all by himself. I can't imagine what James Brolin had to say to Barbara when he screened this one for her. Hopefully the paycheck was really big. Other than Stiles we have to say: Terrible acting - Awful Script - Insipid Humor. What a disappointment!,134
0,Huh? This games graphics seem 2000 years old!!!,"I don't understand who likes this game? The graphics are VERY ancient. There also is no adventure to this game. The only thing you do is level, and level, and level. The adventure tasks that your trainer gives you have about 30 words in them, that's all. 30 words that's all, thats the big adventure in this game? To show that your in a city, there are 4 or 5 stones around in a circle, thats it. I think a high school student could of done a much better job. By the way I only played Midgard, I don't know about the other realms.But don't take my word for it, you can download and play for free. Just check out the graphics, and redundant music, its embarrassing. Go to the co. main website download the game and play for free if you really want to see BAD.",147
0,Truly a waste of two hours,"It takes a lot to drive me to write a review, but this film has just wasted two hours of mine and my husband's time, and therefore I feel strongly about it. We were attracted to the film because of the fantastic cast, and they did act beautifully. However, this was a long drawn out story with a beginning and a middle, but no end. It was painfully slow, and with hindsight, we should have given up after the first long painful hour, but we persevered in the hope it would improve. None of the characters were likeable, and therefore it was difficult to care what happened to them.... and given that the scriptwriter couldn't be bothered to create an end for the film, I can only assume he felt similarly.",131
1,Glen Campbell never fails to please.,"In 1967, Glen Campbell's ""Gentle On My Mind"" was the first L.P. I ever purchased, and I've been buying Glen's records (and CDs) ever since. ""Somebody Like That"" lives up to all expectations, and there's even a booklet with the lyrics (just in case you are brave enough to sing along!) Unfortunately, on track 9 ""(If I'd Only Known) It Was The Last Time"", there are four verses printed, but Glen only sings the first three, repeating the third verse and leaving the fourth out entirely. It's a great song and I almost feel cheated, as I now really want to hear that last verse! Anybody out there got a copy of the entire song? Apart from that, if you're a Glen Campbell fan and don't have this CD, go on out and buy it. You won't be sorry.",139
1,Complete,"I have read many holocaust books of survival but this one left a mark on my heart. The story of a teenage girl, beginning to grow up and notice boys is suddenly thrust into concentration camp after concentration camp. Being torn from her family and placed in a Hell she didn't deserve or understand. This book is hard to read(emotionally)but is one of the greatest I have ever read. I will never forget it.",74
1,Absolutely a blast...a kick in the pants!,"This DVD is a lot of fun to listen to. It's not quite as much fun to watch, but the music is fantastic and the sound quality was great for a DVD. I listen to it at work on a Dell computer with Sony MDR-V150 headphones and it sounds great. There is a lot of energy coming from the songs on this DVD and you will find yourself tapping your feet a lot. If I were at home and wanted to listen to something fun over the home stereo, this would definitely find it's way into the entertainment system.",99
1,I have more of a question then a review.,"I do like having the series on dvd dispite the music being missing. That being said, does anyone know the name of the song at the end of the dye dye my darling episode that replaced the original? I just like the song, and I've been trying to find it.",50
1,Very Good Radio,"This is a very good portable radio. It is very good if you hate turning the dial on the other portable radios. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars cause I thought that the headphones where not of the best quality. If you get this product, I would get some new headphones. You hear a lot of static with them.",61

0,Sometimes humour just doesnt translate,"John Kennedy Toole is a fine sophisticated writer of that there is no doubt. His turn of phrase is descriptive and vivid and his clarity of expression is a pleasure to read. His Pulitzer prize was earned and deserved in my opinion. However, sometimes humour and other charactistics of story telling, which is what this book definitely is, just don't cross borders. While I could appreciate the talent of the writer in an abstract manner, the story did nothing to entertain me. I was basically left unsatisfied and rather replused by much of the story, due, I am sure, to the inability of a non-american to relate to a very colloquial and private joke.",114
1,Love these books,I have quite a few of the Tarzan books and they are such a fun read. You have to get use to the fact that these are not like the Tarzan movies but once you get past the fact that Tarzan is just as much at home going to the opera as he is living in the jungle then you can sit back and have a good read.,68

1,I would love to be marooned with these guys!!,"This CD has just about everything for a Barenaked Ladies lover. It has the commonly heard on the radio tunes like Pinch Me, Falling for the First Time, and Too Little Too Late. And some great new ones that express funny, serious and what were they on when they wrote this. As much as I want to describe the greatness of each song, I won't since there is no way to do that without exploding from finding that one word that isn't in the English language. They are great, funny, smart people who need to keep writing great songs like these! I urge you (did you say urge?) to buy this CD and bask in all that is the brilliant Barenaked Ladies!",122
1,Awesome!,I loved looking through the pictures in this book. It took me a while to get through all of them. I'm reading other Beatle bio books and it is nice to have this to go along with them and be able to look through photos and timelines.,47
1,I love the RDS,"This little FM transmitter works great for me. I love the RDS feature that puts the band and song name on my car stereo. I am terrible at remembering names like these. So that feature is perfect for me.I like the on screen transmitter frequency control. I get great reception in my area. When going to bigger metro areas, I have to change channels and the three select buttons plus the ability to adjust with a simple click makes it easy to find a clear space.The only problem is the lighter socket of my truck was a little shallow for the Kensington and it didn't want to hold a connection. I use a power splitter to be able to connect a phone charger and never have issues.This is my first iPod transmitter and I have been super pleased with it.",140
0,The projector does not work as advertised!,"We were VERY dissapointed with the quality of this product, the picture from the projector is extrememly blurry. This is not a good use of money and had we not lost some of the ""movie disks"" we would have taken it back for a refund!",45

0,EXTREMELY POOR QUALITY (SINGES FROM HOT OVEN),"PROS: Large mitt size with good wrist and lower arm protection.CONS: Poor quality cheap outer fabric, not inexpensive given only 1 mitt is included.WOULD I BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN: No!REASONS: In the first week of use, I picked up a very hot metal tray from the oven broiler and the outer fabric on the mitt thumb singed (burning a small hole in the outer fabric exposing the inner layer of insulation material. Later in the first month of use, the same happened a second time only worse - the hot pan burned and blackened a hole the size of a half-dollar (I had to open the sliding glass door to outside to clear the smoke out of the kitchen.

0,Do not buy!!!,"Bought these for my Bostitch framing nail gun. Nail gun was purchased earlier this year for some home improvement projects. Two problems with these nails. First they do not advance with two clips properly. Have to pull back the lever every so often to make the nails advance. Not a problem until your 30 feet in the air trying to nail something and it misfires. So have to use one clip of nails at a time, what a pain when you are installing plywood or OSB (still does not adavance every time). Just the other day I had a nail jam in my gun, took over 30 minutes to fix. Long story short switched brand of nails to BC & Eagle. What a difference, no jams and can use multiple clips!!! Do not buy these, you would think Bostitch nails would work with their framing nailer??? Plus come on amazon, you shipped these without an extra box, half the clips are falling apart due to shipment. Noticed someone else complain about this????",172

1,My Favorite Children's Story,"My dad read this book to me when I was growing up. It's always been my favorite. Now I read it to my son. It's definitely not a politically correct book but it's perfect for any small intelligent, insatiably curious member of a rather non-P-C family. =)",47
1,Refreshing Illustrations for a Plastics Text,The illustrations in this book are clearly its greatest strength. The illustrator does a fabulous job of taking complex ideas and technical text and making them clear using enlightening 3D diagrams.,31
1,Fantastic grip on reality,"Faulkner's use of the stream of conciousness allows the reader to get into, not only the lives of his memorable characters, but their thoughts, their dreams, and their souls. In the Compsons, Faulkner has craeted a family not soon forgotten. It is not a family to be admired and their circumstances should be avoided at all costs, but the Compson family is very easily identified with. The book draws the reader into the thoughts of the dying South and all that the ""South"" entails. The book is a challenge but gets pleasantly simple after the first two books. Faulkner's style either gets clearer or you as the reader become more accustomed to the style. Either way, the book is truely a classic that I would recommend to any of my friends.",131
1,Very Great Spooky Thriller,"I watch this movie practically every night. For two main reasons, first because Kiefer Sutherland is in it and second because I love thrills, chills and horror in movies. This movie was very creative when it comes to mirrors. I give it two thumbs up. The movie really opens up in a thrilling chilling scene where the prior security guard Kiefer will be replacing is running is the NYC subway station in Harlem from something creepy and winds up hiding in a locker room where he finds a small window which he hopes to escape through but to his ""Oh F***!"" surprise when he opens it he finds it is bricked up and he cannot get out. Being he has hit a dead end he turns around, apologizes to the mirrors and suffers the unthinkably brutal fate in store for him by the mirrors. And here is where the terrifying story opens! Watch on and enjoy!",156

Let me just say that I love the social issues addressed and as someone who loved Beatrix Potter as a child, she would be so proud to have been a part of this work. So cleverly told, and so well done. His depiction of the Lake District is also spot on. Everything about this book is so organic and real. You feel like you can see yourself in all of the main characters.

1,THE Horror Classic,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the best and most influential horror videos of all time. Though this film does not get enough recognition, it is one of the best flicks out there on the market in the horror genre. The only room for improvement on this video would have been more detail in the murder scenes for those like me who are partiallly desensitized, and need more for optimal enjoyment of a ""slasher"" flick. If there is any horror ""fan"" out there that has not seen this film, then he or she is not a true fan of the art of horror videos. I reccomend The Texas Chainsaw Massacre to even those who are not fans of the genre, for it is pure greatness.",126

I wish the author would have included rhythym as well. I have yet to use it with my students.",70

In addition Geddy Lee's voice is now in poor shape, his vocals are nowhere near the qaulity of the original recordings on the albums. However there is alot of material here aside from the conceet to dwell on, for a true Rush fan this set is a must, but don't overexpect.",76
0,Honestly not very good..,"I like the books. At least the early books, and I'm an avid video gamer so when I saw they had a Left behind game, I decided to give it a whirl. First of all, even though my PC is up to spec, the game has REALLY long load times. The tutorial was beastly, the interface awkward. The units (people), look too similar, and have specific assigned genders (such as no female soldiers, etc.) Halfway through the monstrously long and unweildy tutorial I gave up. The graphics and the clunky iterface just didn't do it for me.I think this series would make a better adventure game... You know with puzzles and traveling to exotic locations (like those produced by DreamCatcher) The LB universe is so interesting it would really shine in that kind of environment. Particularly if characters could visit places such as Jerusalem, New Babylon, and Tribulation force HQ.The one plus to this game was the soundtrack. It was beautiful.",161
0,Made my problems worse!,"My son is post colicky so this book was not helpful at all to me. He showed no sleepy signs due to being chronically overtired. He cried MORE often and for longer durations after implementing most/all of the books suggestions and got up even more during the night! This book is best for those who nurse and co-sleep, and are willing to be up nights for months on end. It obviously worked for many, but not me! I found that it made all my son's problems worse which were only cleared up after implementing the steps from ""Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child."" My son is napping pretty regularly now after only a couple of weeks, and his disposition is markedly improving! He went from being up 2 or 3 times a night to sleeping 12 hours straight!!!!!!!! AND with LESS crying IF ANY! ""No-Cry"" is NO GOOD for me.",149
0,Ruth needs a break,"It's not that I didn't enjoy reading this book or most of it. Ozick is a interesting writer with a unique style which I liked but the story was incredible depressing. This idealistic lawyer (Ruth Puttermesser) is put through so much disappointment and misery,(to what end I can not fathom), it seems she is attacked at every turn. Even her dreams/fantasies destoy her. It was that ending that took this book from 4 or 5 stars to 2. I really don't need books to have happy endings but Ozick truly but Ruth through Hell. I don't think it was fitting and it damaged the whole story for me. Let hope Ozick life is better than Ruth's.",116

New Year is my favorite song, but all the songs are really good. if you have the cash to get this cd, do it, because it's well worth the money. they have really meaningful lyrics, excellent guitar and are just really well put together. GET THE CD!",77
0,Sent wrong book and didn't even have book I ordered in stock,I ordered this book as a gift. It took about a month to come and when it arrived they had sent the wrong book. After I contacted the seller they finally replied to say they did not even have the book I ordered in stock. Very disappointing.,47
0,MAGIX PIANO & KEYBOARD WORKSHOP 2ND EDITION,"THE RATING FOR THIS PROGRAM IS ZERO STARS. I CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AND WAS PUT OFF WITH NO REPLY MY HOME PHONE IS 703 685 4935. WHEN I TRIED TO MAKE A BACKUP DISC MY COMPUTER SAID THAT THERE ARE ERRORS ON THE DISK. THE SAME RESPONSE WITH TWO DIFFERENT COMPUTERS. I WASTED TWO BLANK CDs. I WANT A PROGRAM DISK WITH NO ERRORS. MICROSOFT SAID THAT IT DOES NOT RECOGNISE ANY OF THE ""E"" MAIL ADDRESSES I COPIED FROM THE INSTRUCTION BOOK. THE PROGRAM HANGS UP ON WINDOWS 98. IT MAY BE DUE TO THE ERRORS ON THE DISK REPORTED WHEN TRYING TO MAKE A BACKUP. NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTACT THE MANUFACTURER IS NOT HELPFUL. THE OTHER THREE PROGRAMS I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON ARE ALL WORTH FIVE STARS BUT I REGRET HAVING BOUGHT THE MAGIX PROGRAM.",138
1,Great condition for such an old book!,"I ordered this book for my father. We were talking on the phone one night and he asked me if I knew where I could get this book. While we were talking I checked Amazon and found it immediately. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars was because I ordered it for my Dad. This book was printed in 1933 and in such great shape, as it was advertised.",71
1,Felt like revisiting my childhood!!,"I absolutely LOVED Party of Five when it was on TV, the characters were great and the storylines were gripping and for the time hard hitting.Party of Five isn't avaliable in England so to be able to buy this and relive all my favourite characters is fantastic. I can't wait for the other Seasons to be released on DVD so that I REALLY can feel like a teenager again!!I would recommend everyone who loved this TV show to go out and buy this DVD, it's nicely packaged and although there aren't many Bonus Features on it the show itself makes up for it.",103
0,TERRIBLE phone!,"This phone has been a nightmare from day one. I had to return the first one I bought because the handset often refused to turn on and the answering machine was acting up. The second phone was good for about a month, then the battery refused to charge all the way, the sound quality became horrible, and the phone began cutting out on me frequently. If I sit right next to the base, turn off my fan and do not move an inch when talking, sometimes I can hear a caller through an entire phone call. On long calls I often have to hang up (or I get involuntarily cut off) and call back in order to try and clear background noise and static. The answering machine ocassionally blurts out ""Please leave a message"" of it's own accord--creepy late at night. I will NEVER buy another ATT phone again!",149
0,Say what!,"I read the book and feel it can be summarized as follows: ""Think good thoughts and direct them at your navel. Sit up straight when you do so. Be careful, your navel is going to just burn up with energy. This energy is good for you."" And it says this over and over again in 193 pages. Clearly I'm missing something (I hope). I'm relying on other readers to clarify what I missed.",73
0,Total Rubbish,Very dissapointing DVD - had great expectations given the cast - the storyline and manner in which it was directed was dismally poor - do not buy this film!,29
0,Bored Out of My Gourd,"This was all plots and plans and no action. While it might have pictured what life was actually like in the Boleyn/Howard family, there was no action to it -- and I know that ""plots and plans"" can actually make a decent book, because ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" proves it!Thankfully, I didn't buy this book alone (I bought it at the same time I bought ""The Queen's Fool""), or I would've discounted Ms. Gregory as a truly boring author altogether. Hopefully, this book was just a fluke and her others (like ""The Constant Princess"" and ""The Virgin's Lover"") are just as good as ""The Queen's Fool"".",106

1,Favorite Book Of The Series,"This has been my favorite of the Dark Age series. The story follows Clan Jade Falcon and their descant (invasion) into the Inner Sphere. A good bit of background into the Battletech/Mechwarrior universe makes this a much better read and I found myself checking the mechwarrior wiki page for context.I found the political intrigue of the 'heroic' defenders interesting and the conflicting views of the Jade Falcon leaders Malvina and Aleks very griping as well.The psychology of leadership and warfare comes out in the two leaders. Action Adventure novels tend to glorify war but Victor Milan did a good job describing it as what it is: brutal, ugly, and painful. . . But can also be honorable and just.Five Stars",120
1,Performs exactly as described.,"This item performs exactly as was described in any of the marketing information I read. That, in and of itself, is something to be happy about. Keeps coffee hot up to 36 hours, is easy to disassemble and clean, and the Stainless Steel is well worth the extra $$. The last one I had was aluminum, and it became dulled and dirty looking over time. This one looks new all the time.",72
1,A cool retro microphone,"I recommend the whole kit, with C01U USB studio condenser microphone, desktop stand and carrying case.Fidelity is top notch, although I am still working on ideal volume settings and microphone placement since the recording levels are on the soft side at present. But I have been able to adjust with no distortion for my recording projects.Can't wait to take it ""on the road.""",63
1,Italmodern Gracy Leather Chair,"I took a chance and bought these chairs based on just the picture and the few reviews. I must tell you that these chairs are very sleek. They are well constructed and are very sturdy. The packaging was outstanding and all parts were included.I would like to get another pair of these, but it looks like they only come in sets of four. Great find and I am very pleased!",70
1,Space is the Place for Ace,"Shooting for the stars, this September 1978 solo release from KISS lead guitarist Ace Frehley delivers a strong effort which has a great mix of pop and rock.The snappy New York Groove was a worthy single and it reached #13 on the Billboard chart, with I Was Made For Lovin' You peaking two slots higher. The album scored platinum sales status and made it to #26 on the Billboard chart.The studio band is essentially Frehley - guitars, bass, vocals and guitar synthesizer - and drummer Anton Fig, with bassist Will Lee appearing on three numbers. By keeping the musical framework simple, Frehley achieved a higher orbit than his other band members who issued solo efforts at this time.",118
1,"Works well, but antenna cable is a little short...","Bought it for a 2nd computer that is on the other side of the house (100 feet or so). Used the drivers provided (running WinXP Pro). Usually has 3-4 bars (out of 4) of reception, has not caused a reboot that I know of (system is not on for long spans of time). The only problem is that the cable does not allow me to place the antenna on top of the CPU case (full-sized desktop case).Overall, a very good rating.",81

0,Not 8X Compliant,These disks are NOT 8X compliant with the LITE-ON 8X DVD Dual Layer drive. Chances are they aren't compliant with any DVD recorder - they will only record at 4x speed. The label on the inner circle of the DVD clearly indicates 8X in the DVD write speed.,48

0,This one plays fast and loose with history...,"...but remains entertaining. We had just seen ""Iron Man"" at the theater earlier in the day (a phenomenal film) and were still in a movie mood, so we dropped by Blockbuster to see what was out.""The Last Legion"" caught our eye and seemed right for our mood so we took a shot.While I winced at the references to ""the gods"" (at the time this film was ostensibly taking place - 432 A.D. - the Holy Church of Rome was well established) this film was still fun and shot beautifully. I felt like my eyeballs would pop at it's sumptuousness, as it looks that good on an HDTV.I'd give it two and a half stars if I could figure out how to get half a star to light up on Amazon's rating system.While it's no ""Troy - Director's Cut"", ""The Last Legion"" isn't wasted time.",144
1,A great resource,"James Robinson is a tremendously well-versed and insightful theologian. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Theology, so I've read a lot of his material - as well as those from other theologians. Robinson does a masterful job presenting some rather challenging concepts regarding Q. Though not comprehensive, this book is a ""must have"" for any serious scholar-wanna-be (like me) or others who are honestly interested in learning more about ""the greatest story ever told""!",75
0,Does this guy have Tourette's about illicit sex and drugs?,"It takes a white to get going--and then doesn't. This is the third book I've read of Tropper's and while there is a degree of sex and drugs in his other books, this one is only about teenage sex and pot (despite any claims to the contrary). It's quite egregious. I'm not a prude but there's only so much you can take and then it's just a bad joke--pointless, embarrassing and boring. I couldn't even finish the thing.",78

0,Boring,"After reading the other two bio's on melissa, I couldn't wait for her to write her own. I was very disappointed. When mentioning her band she completely leaves out Dave Beyer. Talk about a slap in a the face for him. I thought she would have a least put in more stories of being on the road instead of rehashing old interviews. Bascially I'm sorry I wasted my money. Don't get me wrong I'm a major Melissa fan. I just thought the book [stunk].",84
0,This movie is a bad as it gets,"I can't believe Hollywood would make such a film as Freaked. It should be called ""Boring"", and a waste of time and money.Their is no plot, and it just rambles along. The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes at least had some suspense to it. Despite the big name actors in this --it goes nowhere. If you like movies made for celebral pygmies then maybe you like Freaked.",67

1,Almost perfect CD Alarm Clock Radio with Digital Tuner,"The alarm clock is great. You can set up to 3 different times for the alarms to go off 1 utilizing the radio, 1 the cd player and 1 the buzzer. The only thing I have found to be quite annoying with it is that the cd alarm function is quite limited. You set a track to play off the cd you have and it will play that track and only that track to wake you up unless you change it. Additionally, when you press snooze it turns it off rather than say pausing it so if you are like me and hit snooze one or two times before waking, it keeps playing the beginning of the one track you selected so instead of pausing the song so you don't hear the same 30 seconds of the intro to the song EVERY time the alarm goes off. Other than that I love it, especially on the weekends when my husband or I have to go to work and the other doesn't or one needs to get up at a different time than the other, you don't need to worry about resetting the alarm time!!!!",194
1,Interesting story,I enjoyed listening to my daughter read this story. It is exciting and we both enjoyed the storyline. We patiently awaited each day we read this story to find out what the next mysterious adventure would take us. Great story.,40
0,This CD is a worn out LP transfered to CD...,They took the audio from a worn out record and then tried to clean up it with digital noise suppression. It leaves the whole CD sounding murky and without any life whatsoever. It's unfortunate that all the intrusive noise reduction artifacts make this CD an unpleasant listen. It could've been a cool experience.I wonder what happened to the original tapes? Couldn't they even find a copy or safety somewhere? Unfortunate.,70
0,Good while it lasted...,"I got this as a Christmas gift from some friends after my last DVD player gave up it's ghost. It's now July...about 7 months later...and this player is dead already. It was fine up until a week ago, where you had to open/close the DVD tray several times to make it read a DVD. Now it won't recognize any disc at all. Sure, it's cheap...but only lasting half a year is still too short for any kind of product to be considered a good buy - at least in my opinion.",91

0,Suffers from an over-simplified worldview,"Originally published in 1973, ""Dominion Over Demons"" spells out Maxwell Whyte's arguments in defense of exorcism, but he makes the statement that ""every accident, misfortune, quarrel, sickness, disease, and unhappiness is the DIRECT result of the individual work of one or more wicked spirits."" In other words, White's book appears to promote the use of ""The Devil made me do it"" as an all-purpose cop-out. Still, this book is an interesting research tool for those who study exorcism/deliverance ministry in that it is one of the earlier books in the modern-day deliverance movement.",93

1,Modern Aesops Story,This is an impressive and fun to read book. It offers children a terrific opportunity to sharpen critical thinking skills while empowering their interest in politics. Absolutely wonderful; My twin girls loved it. I also bought a copy for my local public library. There is currently a waiting list to check it out.,53
1,Great headgear,Helmet fits my sons head with no problem. Product seems to be durable he has not had any accidents to test that part. It seems like any other helmet that would be purchased at at store.,36
0,Bad Fit,"I purchased this and the Boppy Maternity Support Band at the same time - and I'm 31 weeks pregnant, with some ongoing feelings of thigh pain and belly pressure. For me, the mini cradle was ill-fitting, as many other reviewers have said. The largest hook-and-eye setting was just too large, and the medium setting was far too small. Additionally, the band was uncomfortable, and I was not able to find a position that worked for me.The Boppy band was much more supportive, and it's extra width helped lift my belly more evenly than the Mini Cradle, which put a lot of pressure on one area. I'm planning to return this product.",111
1,Works good,These fit perfectly under my vanity in the bathroom. They were easy to assemble but are not the most stable. I knew that purchasing them that a foldable laundry basket wouldn't be as strong as a non-foldable one. Full of clothes they are great bc it's not as flimsy. It fits about 1 week worth of clothes. I just wish they had darker colors bc I am hoping in time these don't get too dirty.,75
1,Amazing!,The talent shown on this album is unbelievable.There is an open space in my CD player for This Side when it comes out.,23
0,Trash,"If you liked ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" you'll hate this novel. This is a classic case of an author who stumbles upon a best seller, and the publishers quickly trot out all the writer's earlier bombs. This is a silly story of a sex crazed teenage girl who commits just about every crime in the book to hold onto the estate she loves but cannot inherit. This is the first of a trilogy, and reviews suggest books 2 and 3 are rewinds of the same basic idea. Ridiculous!--never would have read it except I had the flu.",97

I even checked on kindle for PC and the problem is there as well.I hope this opinion might help to solve the problem, otherwise I will have to buy another version.",99
0,An Illogical Chain of reasoning,"When I read this book, I was amused by it. To say that the disorder in Africa benefits someone--e.g., via corruption--has been around for some time and is nothing new. To say that this disorder somehow makes the societies ""work"" is new but illogical. For something to ""work"" for the continent as a whole it must have positive net benefit. Right now, the disorder in Africa is such that the benefit to those who gain is far less than the loss to those who lose. This is a well-known research result. Africa doesn't work; the disorder results in a net loss to Africa. Why Africans do not do enough to change the institutional and organizational order is an interesting reasearch topic. How one can help Africans do something about this predicament is also an interesting research topic. But to say that the disorder works is illogical.",146

1,A must!,"I've read this book in Polish so literary values of the English translations are not the point of my reflexion.I just wanted to say - this book will make yours eyes sweat...It never happened to me while reading. I just could not stop crying.No great classical novels have ever made me feel this way. This modest book appears in an era when writing a GREAT novel is wirtually impossible. We all know why, and we all agree. Of course - great novels can appear in the context of postmodern American Literature, but they don't necessarily make a great read.Schlink does it with his modesty and understatement.And one more thing: THIS BOOK IS NOT ABOUT HOLOCAUST. The author had chosen the Poles to be the victims in this book - please respect it. 3.000.000 Poles (besides another 3.000.000 Jewish citizens of Poland) died from German atrocities during WWII - and when one uses the word Holocaust it denies them the right to memory.",162
1,Smooth Operation,I didn't use the iron immediately because I was worried about the weight. However I did use it for the first time yesterday and the digital temperature is a great feature knowing exactly when the desired level of heat is reached. The surface of the sole plate is unbelievably smooth and the iron literally glides over the item. That alone is reason to buy this iron. It is so smooth that I didn't notice the 3.5 lbs. I would recommend this iron.,82

1,"Poorly-written, nonetheless extremely important and gutsy","This book is not very graceful. The prose is childish. Goldberg often uses profanity. And there is not much of a flow to the argument.However, I still think that this book is extremely important - and Bernard Goldberg is a very courageous man. It is true that the media is very arrogant and very tiltied to the left. We've all known it for years. Now, one of the insiders who has personal experience has confirmed what we've all known all along.The book offers a behind-the-scenes look at CBS News. It affords us an extremely important perspective on an important issue of our time. I would recommend it to anyone - conservative or liberal.",113
0,spend a little more...,"I bought this cd because I enjoyed the pianist's playing of the two chopin concertos, available on the Naxo's label. However, this recording in no way matches the artistry of lugansky, pollini, ashkenazy, or perahia. If someone is looking for a budget recording, berezovsky's is worth every penny and much more. The sound on Szekely's recording is marred by a murkiness, but it does not hide the pianist's wrong notes, which one would overlook in a live recording given the difficulty of the chopin etudes, and his hestiation to inhabit these works. Instead, these interpretations seem, like the recording, distant and unfocused. Save some money and spend a little more on the pollini, lugansky, perahia, or berezovsky.",117

Where is the heartfelt desperation and alcohol fueled raggedness, that give the band is uniqueness? There is some pleasant pop music on ""Pneumonia"" but what the Hell, you can get that from the Foo Fighters etc...I see a tuneless and hookless future, full of critical acclaim from people who never much cared for country music anyway.",98

0,Shoddy Journalism,"Edward Klein is getting rich off of ""shoddy journalism."" Anyone who reads this book and takes the opinion that it's a good read or he did his homework and research on Hillary Clinton is a fool. It may contain entertainment purposes for some, but it's only pure garbage. The only reason why this book is selling is not because Edward Klein's name is on it, but because some writer's and journalists find it imperative to attack a woman who has a very good chance of being our first female American President; not to mention the huge profit factor involved for Klein and the publisher (s).I completely disagree with this book and the ""facts"" (if you can call them that) in this book.

I knew that I had to find the same model again.It is so easy to operate and to clean. It brews a great pot of coffee.I also love the program feature.

Todd used sound effects records to create the audience noise, so I wonder what the other reviewers had for breakfast that day!If anyone saw Todd perform with ""A Walk Down Abbey Road"" this year, or last, they will know what he can do with a cover song.Many fans say ""Todd is Godd"", but personally, I am pushing for Saint-hood!",87
0,Waste of time/money,"The techniques used were pretty old school and not so much for today's digital world. Majority of the pictures inside the book aren't impressive at all. The cover shot seems to be the best one but anyone can take that same picture with the right amount of light. I didn't learn anything I haven't already read online. Books on car photography are extremely limited, but even so I would not recommend reading this book. Read the other one by James Mann instead.",82
1,Best of Its Kind,"Of the 7 or so books on this topic I've bought on this topic, this is the best. The technique taught here - of trimming the edges before matching pieces - works better than what I'd tried to do from previous books. Furthermore, the designs are just down-right PRETTIER than those in most of the others. Patterns are a bit too small for my skill level, so I cheated by using a copy machine to ""enlarge"" slightly (125%). I'm absolutely delighted with the finished product.",85
1,A world we can't imagine,"As a mother myself, my heart broke reading this story of courage. Though the first chapter was more like a travel journal, the story became engrossing when grandmother's story took over. Though the writing is somewhat amatuerish at times, the story is none-the-less emotional and compelling. I learned a lot about life in Korea - a life we in America could not imagine. I heartily recommend this story of courage.",70
1,Haunting,"Unbreakable is not your fiery Bruce Willis actioneer and may be considered to be slow and brooding. If you like a movie that brings you into the all too everyday and mundane exsistence of a security guard and completely turn it upside down in suttle but errie ways. If you want to see Bruce play a realistic and memorable character in a film about the fantastic you will love this movie. Samuel L. Jackson is outstanding as a tragic art dealer who specializes in comic art, his character is named Elijah Price and will remind you of the mysterious people Vincent Price portrayed. Perhaps M.Night Shylaman was doing an off handed tribute to the late great Vincent. Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark turn in great performances as well. This is the kind of movie you will not just watch once.",142
1,Insightful!,"This is a book very much in the tradition of Jack Schwager's Market Wizards. Like Schwager, author Michael Covel interviewed a number of great traders and attempted to capture the essence of each trader's approach to trading. The author does a good job of presenting the basics of trend following. Though much of what he says will come as no news to anyone who has read very widely in the literature of trading, his liberal quotations from other authors enliven what would otherwise be an uphill read. The author has a good eye for a snappy quote, and we believe that even if you buy this book only for the quotations, you will certainly get your money's worth. What you earn from following the trend masters' stock tips is entirely up to you.",133

(And yes, I did remove the packaging before consuming the soup) I had low expectations for this soup and it managed to fall very short of them. Fortunately, a few dashes of soy, squirts of Sriracha, and squeezes of lime allowed me to pinch my nose and pour the stuff down my throat.So, if you hate miso soup, and have a hankerin' for a plasticky aftertaste, Annie Chun's Miso Soup Bowl might just be your ticket to paradise.",113

Jackie McLean is a perfect compliment to Lee and the rhythm section including the great Billie Higgins is cookin' up a storm.

With a newborn you go through so many diapers you end up using about 1-2 refills a week and I couldn't afford that with everything else a newborn needs. When it did start ok it did keep the smell minimal. Oh, there also wasn't anywhere to put wipes after you closed the diaper up and put it in the thing so you end up putting it in the trash where it smells...If you have the time and energy to change the refills at 2am then go for it.

1,"Really good game, very fun","I thought this was a cool game when I first played it. You can make cool sound effects go with the scenery, have Disney characters judge your ride and ride actual roller coasters from Disneyland. I just wish that there was:1. More Toontown and Frontierland scenery2. More lands to build your rides on3. Bigger spaces to build your ridesand 4. Some way to build a pond so you wouldn't have to put boats on dry land.What I DO like about it is:1. You can ride your ride or other rides2. Great sound effects3. Great graphics4. It's addictive!!I also liked the ""Flying"" coaster, which makes it look like you are soaring through the air without any supports. I also like that some scenery will activate(blow up, burn ect.) or make sound effects as you ride past.Ultimate Ride Coaster: Disney Edition is a great family game with no horrible violence that other games have. Buy today!",154
0,Usually a great Patterson fan.,"The best thing about this book is it's length. With very short chapters of 2 to 3 pages and half empty pages at the beginning and end of these chapters to stretch it out, this book is a very fast read. It is not your usual Patterson. It lacks everything that is usually found in his books. I did read it all the way through hoping that it would improve as it progressed. This did not happen. All the characters seemed to be shallow and unlikeable and the plot strange because key points such as the plagues of illnesses were unexplained and vague. The ending seemed to be condradictory-if the Devil's child survived the drowning, why did the plagues end? And who found him and raised him with no publicity? Surely a new born baby saved from the ocean would make headlines even in the Irish countryside.",147
0,Eh not as good as you would think,Ok so I was excited to see this movie.. I thought wow a good actress is in it.. That's a bad sign.. I find sometimes horror movies with unknown actors are better..So the beginning is good. The blonde leader kid is good. Creepy. BUT then it starts getting DUMB. So the whole egg scene is bizzare. I dont wanna give away too much but she's just stupid the second time she puts up with it..and WHY on earth didn't she tell her friends!!!!!!! CMON!Then I also thought she has knives in the kitchen she couldve grabbed one quick and sliced the guys! BUT NOOOOOOOO............Overall.. I was dissapointed. The ending was UGH..

It shows poignantly what happens with a depressed, angry young person.

Also you would need a dvd-audio player to be able to listen to the music. You can listen to this disc on any regular dvd player of cd player. It does have Dolby digital 5.1 and dts 5.1 tracks on the disc but that means any dvd player will play those tracks.

It will explain what everything does, but it doesn't show you how to use it. I found myself referring to the GoLive online help to understand the book. I finally gave up and purchased the SAMS Teach Yourself Adobe GoLive 5. A much better book for the beginning user and half the price.

0,Intellectual Dishonesty,"As a PhD student in the UK studying religion and American foreign policy, I was hoping to find in Diamond's book a thoughtful and well-researched account of the religious right in America. What I have just read is a piece of shock journalism. Diamond's intent throughout is to paint the religious right (which she defines so ambiguously that it is meaningless) as a monolith whose unified intention is to support murderous dictators and greedy multinationals - whenever and wherever possible. This book is an excellent example of how ""good"" research - when it is driven by intellectually dishonest aims - produces ""bad"" (distorted/unbalanced) ends.",104

1,"Great book, especially for beginners","I was thinking about getting a parakeet so I bought this book and it taught me everything I ever wanted to know about what having a parakeet would entail. I did notice there was nothing about breeding parakeets, but as a new parakeet owner that is far from my top concern at this point. Everything in the book was pertinent to what I needed to know. There was a great chapter on setting up your home for the parakeet and everything you would need to get and how to make your home safe, as well as a chapter about all the different things you can feed your parakeet (including several easy recipes that your parakeet is guaranteed to enjoy!) There are too many parakeet owners out there who neglect their birds, and this book teaches you how to be a great owner instead. I know that when my hand-fed baby parakeet comes home with me in a few weeks the knowledge I gained from this book will make me a great budgie owner!",173

It is not the clash of the Native American culture versus the White culture, but rather a clash of the Anglo-American culture versus the Germans from Russia immigrant culture. It is of two white cultures that have different views of life and how it is to be lived. It is well worth the read. The book arrived in good time and was as described.",123

The base should be bigger so you can rest at least some of your hands in front of the buttons and next to the joystickOther than that, for 45bucks...this is pretty hard to beat, the quality is very good, inputs are accurate, the buttons are not flimsy...cant beat this stick at its price...its just a less expensive alternative to the 100+ ones -- drawback is its size...great stick on a budgetNOT WIRELESS",170

The scene where the alligator (or whatever it was) is having drug induced Vietnam flashbacks, that was pretty good. In fact, if that had been the only scene, I might have given this movie a good review. The rest of the movie was the sorriest piece of trash I have ever had the misfortune to sit through. I turned the movie off about half way through because it was so bad. I then watched the second half to see if it could get any worse... and it did. This movie was not funny, intelligent, thought provoking, or even mildly entertaining. The only emotions it got out of me was loathing and numbness.",141

I would recommend only buying this for dvds that are irreplaceable. And don't kid yourself- you can't effectively buff these dvds by hand afterward, I tried. You will have to strip more, using up more of the wheel's precious grit, and your dvd will look like crap. Either buy a buffer, or take your resurfaced dvds to a game shop to have them buffed for a small fee. I don't think I quite got my money's worth out of it, but will just cut my losses.",145
1,"As with cars, so with film: the faster the better","Kodak makes the industy's best film. Period. Like the title says, the faster the film, the better the results (for amatures anyway). 400 is the minimum that any amatuer should buy, and generally the results are pretty good. 800 speed is even better, but be prepared to pay more for it. 800 is good for low light and high-speed subjects. However, for most situations, 400 should be fine.",68
1,"Sad Slice of Life, Well Told","This book reflects with painful accuracy the cruel existence of so many poor people in the United States, particularly in New York. Walking these same streets every day, I can say that LeBlanc has captured the very essence of the lives of these people. It is not until one spends time--real time--in a community like the one described here, that one can understand the thinking that goes on. Babies being raised by grandmothers and greatgrandmothers, children being sexually abused by boyfriends of grandmothers, kids being carted off to see their parents in prison. These are real, everyday happenings. This book serves well as a warning call: Unless and until we--those of us who do not live in such an environment--are willing to help make things better, more and more children will be lost to this impossible existence. The author did a beautiful job of showing life as it is, and sadly will be for a long time to come, for so many poor people.",164
0,I won't even give this DVD away,"Just because something has Disney's name on it doesn't mean it is good. This DVD is just awful. I watched it with my 5 year old granddaughter, who loves Belle, and even she said it was 'horrible.' The Beast was ill-tempered throughout the stories, along with being selfish, churlish and childish. There are no good messages for children in this DVD. I am throwing it away as in good conscious I can't donate it to any charity.",77

0,not all it's cracked up to be,I loved the artwork John Byrne has always been a favorite of mine but unfortunatly that's all I got out of this book. the story jumps around too much I wasn't really sure where i was in the story.

0,What were you thinking Joan?,"I've long been a fan of Joan's distinctive vocal sound. What a shame that in her later career she has been the victim of cheesy arrangements and second rate material.

0,Atrocious! Not Atreides!,"This is the worst possible adaptation imaginable. I would have given them credit for changing the story in positive ways -- due to the difficulty of translating such a complex novel. However, this adaptation doesn't even succeed as good space opera.The script, the art direction, the editing -- everything about this movie sucks.I'm not one of those people who thinks that a movie should be faithful to a novel. In fact, a few movies have been definitely better than their books -- notably Jaws, even Silence of the Lambs (book was very good, the movie a masterpiece). However, the point in changing a story is to make something worth watching. Read the book and hope someone makes a better version some day. (I don't recommend the whole of Herbert's series. Dune is excellent. The rest get worse in rapid progression).",140

If you use a heavier fabric than what she used, you may need to adjust the pattern to make it work. I wouldn't recommend this for a complete beginning sewer.

His book gives valuable insights into the psychology of trading, but is no substitute for fundamental market expertise.",85

1,Too limiting,"I think this wonderful book does itself a disservice by limiting itself to what *women* want. In most cases, women want the same things any customer, male or female, wants: to be treated fairly, with respect, and with appreciation. Mary Lou Quinlan has done her homework, that's for sure, but I have heard her speak and I don't think I've ever taken so many notes in my life. The best book on this topic, bar none, is Paco Underwood's ""Why We Buy,"" but this one should also be on the shelf of any sales and/or marketing manager interested in examining why people make those crucial buying decisions - whether a candy bar or an automobile.",115

It started off with the star wanting to commit sucide and the first five minutes were the worst part of the film - and depressing. The movie had no plot and certainly no substance. There was a LOT of profanity which could have been left out. I thought Hollywood and certainly Meg Ryan could have faired better. Don't waste your time and money on this one.,91

1,"A great book for those seeking peace, direction and calmness","I saw a part of Dr. Dyer's seminar on the Learning Channel one night and I knew that I had to get this book. It took me some time to read it, not because it was hard to read, but because it was so interesting that I had to take notes on the side and highlight certain sections. It is a great book if you are looking for peace in your life, a new direction and calmness. The priciples are nothing new but there are things that we take for granted for example the pricinple of positivity. We tend to concentrate our full energy on the negative aspects of life and our loved ones. When in reality what we are doing is attracting negativity and bringing it upon ourselves. How can we expect good things to happen to us if our thoughts and our aura are filled with negativity???This is a book that you need to read several times to grasp every time around different concepts and new meanings that can enlighten your life.",174

1,Good beginning to a series,"This was an enjoyable read, though grisly in places, and I hope the rest of the series is as good. The murderer is revealed rather early on, which I usually don't like, but there were enough plot surprises to make up for that. My only real quibble is that the first 2 murders reference the nursery rhyme ""As I was going to St. Ives..."" which then disappears for the rest of the novel. It wasn't a necessary device to begin with, so his editor should have caught this. But overall a worthwhile mystery.",93
0,Garbage Remix With 80's Gimmickry,"As part of an attempt to capitalize on the success of their Eliminator sound, ZZ Top decided to go back into the studio and remix and also re-record parts of their first 6 albums thinking it would make them more money and entice fans of their newer sound to go back and buy their earlier records. Well guess what, in the process their older fans who were used to the original versions on the old cassettes and albums were shocked when they listened to any of these first generation CD releases. They heard bogus reverbed drums, and entire sections of both music and vocals re-recorded. Talk about tarnishing the legacy of a great band's output. Well someone finally wised up and now at least Tres Hombres and Fandango are now available in original mix, remastered form. So stay away from this trash and wait for the entire back catalog to be released in it's original mix, remastered form on CD.",160

1,Good to accompany a life drawing class,I bought this book quite a while ago and had difficulty getting much from it because I had never had an anatomy class or a life drawing class. Now that I am taking an intensive anatomy/life drawing class I find it excellent and a valuable resource. I have a very good class book called Classic Human Anatomy by Valerie Winslow to show me literal anatomy. This muscle is here and is called this. You need this. But the greatness of Robert Beverly Hale's books are to also show you how these muscles appear in classical drawings. This is a different matter all together. It is the difference between an academic diagram and a great drawing. You need BOTH books and a live drawing class model to get the whole picture (no pun intended!).,133

If I check inside during the mixing phase and scrape the corners this problem can be eliminated- it's just a pain and I don't always remember to do it. It makes great dough, it's easy to use, and is easy to clean. I make all of my own baked goods from scratch.

The breadth of the subject matter is actually helpful and there were some beneficial explanations in this book that I did not find in others - but don't always trust the answers given and do research the inconsistencies.",97
1,"The irony of ""Lucky"".","""Lucky"" is Alice Sebold's ironically titled rape narrative. Her blunt and frank recall of her assault are daunting but - as she notes - she is ""lucky"" to have survived. While not for the faint-hearted her story is important. I recommend it to a broad readership because it poses questions about violence, family, law, punishment and recovery. I liked the truth of this biography and its pacing. Although there is another rape narrative near the end, it added nothing to strengthen the core theme; the book would have done well without it.Personalized, micro-histories of this sort offer valuable opportunities to understand, interpret and feel what are too often vague, anonymous news articles. Sebold's direct style courageously stares this kind of crime straight in the eye without blinking. It is a solid read and a valuable story.",136
0,Don't even bother,"It was a good attempt for a first time publishing author. I'm holding more hope for his subsequent books, however. This one was a flop: it starts out interesting with a thickening plot, but it loses steam and becomes exponentially ridiculous and cheesy. Some of the dialogue from Ashley to her son Jason made me want to gag. All of that ""hun"" talk is quite antiquated and unnecessary. I made it 3/4 through the novel and had to call it quits when I realized it wasn't worth my time. A good attempt, sir, but the next must be better than this or you're off my list.",106

0,Small budget Star Trek.,"ST2 is an enjoyable adventure marred by a miniscule budget.The budget was so small that they re-used effects from the first film,used a television film crew,re-used the bridge set 3 different times for different ships and didn't have the money to finish the Eden Cave effect which was over-exposed.The ship's power source(which Spock repairs)looks like a giant salt shaker on a disco dance floor,hardly the large power source that it should have been,due to the tiny budget of 3 and a half million dollars(the real budget reported at the time).On the plus side,the battle scenes are eccellent,although the nebula looked a little fake at times,and the Kirk/Spock/McCoy interactions are fun the watch.After the slow STTMP,it was good to see the relationships and humour re-ignited on ST2.Nicholas Meyer's direction is good and the music by James Horner is a highlight.So,if you like an entertaining B-grade film then ST2 will entertain you.",150

Thinking that I was messing up, I would go through the steps again just to see if I missed something.

0,Too Sad & Maudlin For Me,"This is designed to be a tear jerker, so keep a roll of toilet paper or some Kleenex on hand if you dare watch this one.Although I liked the book and thought the film adaptation fairly decent, I could not stand the maudlin song that shares the title of the movie.The story is this: in 1985, a lawyer whose marriage is crumbling meets a little boy whose mother is dying. It turns out that Nathan, the boy is the lawyer's wife's pupil. Nathan wants to buy his dying mother shoes so she will look nice when she goes to see Jesus. If that ain't sad enough, the part where Nathan listens to her heart to see if she is still alive was just too hard for me. I had to leave the room on that part. It hammers you over the head with what is really important in life, but still, as other reviewers on the US boards have said, I, too prefer something more upbeat and cheery for the holidays. Although the movie was well acted, the execrable song cost it two stars. That was overkill.",187
1,"A frightening tale of an enslaved, socialist future","1984 is frightening. 1984 is thought-provoking. 1984 is a literary masterpiece, warning society of a possible future that would more or less end meaning in life.

0,"Great idea, poor sound quality","I was so disappointed with the sound quality of this device that I returned it. Music files that sounded great on my computer were noticably reduced in quality due to the FM transmission. I thought Audio Books would work, but there is so much hissing and buzzing that it was hard to concentrate on the book. BE WARNED there is NO REWIND or FAST-FORWARD through a track. There are only forward and backward track skip. If you have a large audio book file and lose your place or forget to pause when you leave the car, you cannot get back to your position in the file. The device ""remembers"" which track you were playing when it loses power, but it starts over from the beginning of the track, not at the place in the track where you left off, as in a CD player. The lack of a power switch seems quite odd to me as well. Overall, the device seemed like a great idea, but it just wasn't thought out well enough.",173
1,Loved this movie!,"My children saw this movie when they were very small in Germany. We bought the VHS because there wasn't DVDs then and they played it to death. They loved Natty Gann. I saw it on Instant and could not believe it. I had to see it again. My oldest son, a slain police officer,@22years old, loved the fact that the wolf got top billing at the end of the movie. He loved the fact that it ended with Wolf played by Jed"". I miss my son so much and when I see this movie, I am reminded how much he loved these type of movies. It was nice to remember our times together. Natty Gann, was one of his favorite, now mine as well.",124

It is very frustrating that even buying this series the second time would still have defects. Something needs to be reported to the company that manufactures these DVDs.",87

0,Disappointed,"We liked the idea of a built-in thermal carafe. But this machine has drawbacks that has made it more of a disappointment than a boon to us:1) The clock isn't backlit.2) The carafe doesn't hold very much coffee. The carafe's bulk is misleading.3) The darn thing drips for several minutes after it has stopped percolating.4) Pouring coffee out of it is a challenge, especially if you're getting near the bottom of the carafe.5) The coffee doesn't stay warm for long, even with the extra-bulky carafe.It is not worth the money we spent. Looks good on the counter, though.It's inevitable that we have to sop up coffee from somewhere every time we use it. Frankly, I want to drink it, not have it end up in a kitchen rag.Recommendation: Buy a Mr. Coffee and a good Thermos carafe (we got ours at a thrift shop for a quarter; it keeps coffee hot for 24 hours!).",154

Then few Weeks latr the Camera breaks, When i go to take a picture it has a black screen. Another thing is the battery, The battery is located inside the phone so if your battery breaks you have to send it to T-mobile to fix it and it takes Around two weeks to fix and the insurence plan I pay for doesn't cover the battery. It cost me like $200. The service is just straight out bad I don't get service practicly any where.Please people don't bother reading the Teenagers reviews because they just use the aol instent messagenger they don't even care for anything else on the phone.I suggest you save your money and if you want a pda cell phone go for the palm treo's.",177

0,Monica's Story was a struggle to finish..,"I plunged into Monica's story with much anticipation, anxious to hear her take on all events that had transpired over the last year. The beginning staged Monica's life growing up, much more detail than most people probably care to know - I wanted to know about her relationship with the President (or at least her perspective) and not her entire life story. She isn't that valuable to society to have us all know this information. The book is not very well-written, with many typos and backwards English. If someone was writing this book about me, I'd make sure I came out looking a little less like a mental case. I found myself skipping pages toward the end and eventually just skipped to the last chapter. It's basically the same thing over and over again - and never once does Monica take ownership, she's always blaming others (maybe that was illustrated in the parts I skipped).",155

1,Excellent until the last 50 pages,"I have read all of Kleypas's works and find them to be very well-written, entertaining, and compelling. This book fit the bill until the last 50 pages or so, when apparently our author realized she had to end the book. To say the least, the ending is farcical and almost unbelievable. Still, the book as a whole was very good, and although the most of the characters were stereotypes, they seemed to fit in this story. I look forward to her next book!",83
1,A must read,"Having just finished this book, I am keen for everyone to read this wonderful and touching novel. The writer is very perceptive..managing to detail the heroes flaws yet keeping us, the reader, hoping for his redemption.I disagree with one reviewer who says it is a man's book..I think it is a book about the frailty and the strength of humanity. We are also given a slight glimpse into Afghanistan, a country we hear about constantly but fail to really know.The plight of Afghanis is examined and it is hard to come away from this book without having sympathy for these people.I also liked the way the book came full circle yet did not end with a neatly packaged ""happy ever after"" ending.Excellent.",122
1,Very enjoyable,"I have read other books about globalization, politics and philosophy but I have never enjoyed it as much as with this one. It's a wonderful love story that goes down like a good glass of wine and I actually picked up some useful information and great ideas on the way - DNA as the collective unconscious -what a great thought. The book really provides some optimism and faith, despite all the problems it deals with. I guess the message is this: it's all part of the process and we'll get there one way or another.",95
1,Great Job All,This movie tells a very good story. T.D. Jakes is a brilliant story teller. I didn't get to see it when it was in theaters due to limited distribution. I heard T. D. Jakes speaking about it on a radio program. My friend purchased the DVD as soon as it was released and was good enough to share it with me. Sharon Leal is so beautiful. She always brings her best to a project. She didn't disappoint. Blair Underwood also is always masterful. I am glad we live in a time that movies are made where these people can showcase their talents. I loved it.,105

I didn't really think about the ingredients too much, figuring if it was called ""all purpose flour"" it would probably work in anything - wrong! Though the texture is nice, the smell and taste completely overpower that benefit.I tried using these to make cookies, and it was horrible...way too much after taste of the bean flavor. Also, the fava bean thing kind of scares me too - apparently kids should not eat it because of possible health risks if they have certain genetic dispositions. Bob's Red Mill has some great stuff that is gluten free, but this one should be labeled as ""garbanzo/fava bean flour"", not all purpose.",130

There was not a single character of which to endear me and as Gannon said I only finished the book because I have a strict policy that I finish each novel I begin hoping in this case that Mr. Donleavy was going to surprise me at the end and justify my decision to finish the book.

0,Bad Acting and Stolen Footage,"This movie couldn't decide if it was a soap opera set in WW II or a docudrama. Heston/ Sullivan romance adds nothing to the movie. Albert's character is winey. If you start watching the movie at the point where the American carriers leave Pearl Harbor is not a bad movie. The scenes of the air attacks on the Japanese carriers is interesting and has a degree of accuracy. Most unforgiveable and annoying thing about the movie is most of the battle on Midway Island is lifted from the attack on pearl Harbor in Tora, Tora, Tora. I know special effects were expensive but that's a trick worthy of a bad B movie.",112

No kidding! That's the secret to healthy living??The positive reviews for this book are bogus. Anyone with common sense will not have a life-altering experience from reading this book (see above for his ""secrets"" to live a long, healthy life. Duh!).

This book took more pages on exercises that it did for explaining the subject. Sections are short, sometimes very short, but exercises--sometimes you'll count them up to 100(!) for just one short section! Man, what kind of reasoning is it? Everyone in the world knows that calc isn't an easy subject to learn, and yet authors do not take their time to explain topics with care.Proofs are so technical, seems like it was written by a computer, not by a human being. Authors like Stewart simply forget that not everybody understands calc the way they do, and that some students, if not all, need extra examples and explanations before they can do a bunch of exercises.",149

With 80 pages of Maltese history, you will get more in depth history here than with any of the other travel guides.The text does not pull any punches with discussing Malta & its people when it comes to their love of killing birds, leaving trash around, stealing car parts, overbuilding the island, being stubborn, or being horrendous drivers. But there is also an understanding and appreciation for the natives. The essays on Maltese people, their vehicles, the architecture, and superstitions are good. The last 20 pages of travel tips are helpful, the hotel recommendations adequate, the description of the various areas of interest detailed.This book is too cumbersome to take along, this is more for pre-trip research.

That this stuff actually works, well, that's something else entirely.

The book starts well enough but then disintegrates; while the places are, for the most part, beautifully described, the characters are poorly drawn, the plot meanders aimlessly from pillar to post until it disappears altogether, and the various jumbled themes can't be addressed satisfactorily in a book this brief and hastily assembled.

0,Don't buy this game!,I bought this to play at a fun New Year's Eve party and it was NO FUN at all! It was very slow to play it and it was not entertaining in any way. We ended up playing Scattagories instead and having a blast.,44
0,Sizes in product description are INCORRECT,"The description says the smallest cutter has a 1.25"" diameter. It is actually well over 2"". Now I need to return these because I was looking for a much smaller cutter.",31
0,Not the original,The original edition is much truer to Hemingway's style. This is an editied edition from his grandson who didnt like what Hemingway originally said about his grandmother.,27
0,Han Will Always Shoot First - Lose New Hope Jabba,"I actually enjoy all the little backround additions GL added into the trilogy, but I just can't get by some of the major changes like Greedo Shooting first and Introducing Jabba in Star Wars.Greedo shooting first I shouldn't even have to explain.CG Jabba looks technically terrible, also a bit wimpy (seems to be getting pushed around by Han) and the build up to a great menacing creature is lost by showing him in the 1st movie.I know I can't pick and choose what to leave in and what to take out, so I would prefer to have the original movies I saw as a kid and that is where my money will go if they are ever released. If not, so be it.GL can do whatever he wants, but I personally will not be buying this on Blu Ray.",139
0,A Disappointment,"Initially, this book looked rather promising. Amis's stylistic touches were nice as usual and for the first hundred or so pages it seemed as though this was really building up towards an intense and revealing climax. Unfortunately, Amis failed to make the plot nearly as interesting as the setting or characters. The ending was horrid and sudden and although it appeared to say something, it really said nothing about either our condition or the mindset of the characters. All in all, an easy read with its fair share of good lines and amusing scenes, but ultimately as unsatisfying as the drugs the characters intake.",104
0,This Book Only Preaches to the Converted.,"This is not simple fiction, folks. It is a preaching tool for Christians to scare people into following them and their religion. Since talk of Hell doesn't seem to bother anyone anymore, propagandists LaHaye and Jenkins have used ""The Rapture"" as a contemporary way of scaring people into ""falling in line."" After all, who would possibly want to be denied the lavishness of heaven by being ""left behind?"" The authors do not wish readers to think of this as mere fiction, but as a warning for a future that they are convinced is coming.Make no mistake. This is not intended as simple science-fiction, or a light Sunday afternoon read. The intent is to convince you that if you do not follow the path that Christians follow, you will be ""Left Behind."" It's arrogant, pushy, and should be seen for what it is: A blatant, recruiting tool for Christianity using fiction and fear as their main weapon.",156
0,100 % Brutality,"Well, the movie itself is brilliant. Cameras, scenes, shots, actors, everybody did a great job. However, it seems to me that the movie's a little bit too brutal. In almost every shot you see somebody getting killed or somebody dead. After an hour or so, I was really bored by this movie.",52
1,finally have it,pretty good movie if your a John Wayne fan. amazon was the only her in Wisconsin i could get this movie from as i am working having an entire collection of John Wayne's movies and this one i have been looking for for some time now. glad i was able to find it here,54
1,If only I could download the data into a GIS...,"Great device. I would really like to be able to access the raw data- the readings of coordinates and time and elevation and heart rate so I could plot them as I need. I've heard of some freeware that could do this, but Garmin really should take the lead here. Also, it seems from the highly erratic speed/pace data that some smoothing is in order... a single errant point (common in GPS receivers, especially those with antennaes being waved around) can cause distortions in speed calculations. But these can be smoother out using averages over several points. Another reason I'd like access to the data. Ok, I'm a geek, but there's great information wasted here! And in the interest of full disclosure- I'm a GRMN stockholder.",126
0,NOT Star Trek!,"Oh, yeah, the enhanced scenery was nice, in some cases even better than the original, but for a long-time Star-Trek fan like me, this version (The Director's Edition) has one modification that totally ruined it. One of the scenes in the all important climax, the one where Decker remarks: ""But of course! We all create God in our own image."" was dropped from this version, no doubt in deference to the more pious consumers. Now this remark was not gratuitous, it was the main moral message and lesson of the entire adventure and an intrinsic aspect of the Star Trek phenomenon which made it (Star Trek) what it is today.Dropping those two lines from the movie changed it from a deeply significant work to just another shaggy-dog story. Boo! Mr. Director. I will hunt down and buy the original cut, thank you.",142

1,A Love Story of Fate,"This movie is so wonderful. It takes you through an emotional journey. The story is about a man and woman in love that live at a lake house... just not at the same time, two years apart to be exact. They correspond through letters left in the mailbox for each other. An incredible tale unfolds about true love and perfect timing.If you enjoyed The Lake House, then I also recommend Just Like Heaven with Reese Witherspoon, another great love story of timing and fate.",84

0,Only for the die hard Hemingway fan.,"This book, although kind spirited, is only for the die hard Hemingway fan who must read everything, true or false, about the man.

0,Nothing spectacular,"Typical compliation fare. Nothing to go run out and get (unless you are an avid ""got-to-have-everything-she-puts-out"" Madonna fan). If you are a casual listener of Madonna (like me), then I'd recommend just dubbing her songs of the radio or borrowing it from a friend. Also, on another note, why did Madonna have the audacity to remake a classic? She is on one with that. Just for butchering a classic, I give her one star. Shame, shame Madonna.",77

1,A new and more experienced Vivanativa,"The album is great, and the songs show they were really worked out, the packaging is a bit flimsy, but still ok.

Lets hope sales are good and that they can do a crossover like other artistsn from Puerto Rico such as ricky martin and Puya",64
0,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE!,"I own quite a few books on tattoos and body modifications, but this one just doesn't make the cut. There was nothing special about the tattoos and piercings featured in this book, you could pick up a copy of any number of tattoo magazines for under ... and see more interesting work. The photography was good for the most part, but the subject matter was lacking. If you want a really good book on this subject get a copy of The Customized Body by Ted Polhemus. Charles Gatewood also has several outstanding books on the subject.If you do decide to buy this one, make sure you save your return label, you'll probably need it.",114

0,Dawkins brought me out of atheism,"I would just like to thank Dawkins for ending my destructive 35 year run-in with atheism. Dawkins' stretched reasoning, poor logic, and self-refuting facts helped me see the light of God. This book is a wonderful expose of how science can degrade into the worst kind of faith. In fact this book is really nothing more than a Bible for atheists. However it advocates a faith without any kind of salvation, just meaningless living. Why doesn't Dawkins take his theory to its logical conclusion and advocate a ""might makes right"" worldview? I suppose it is because he doesn't really believe what he says...",103

I had read Captivated, Entranced and Charmed, and didn't think she could outshine them but she did in Enchanted. If you haven't read any of these books, you're missing a great read.",77

Brian O'Conner (Walker) has left L.A due to his illegal actions from the first movie and now soars the streets of Miami making money here and there by street racing. Watched by Customs Agent Monica Fuentes (Mendes), Brian is caught by the police and is given a deal by Agent Markham and Bilkins to go undercover and try to bring down drug lord Carter Verone (Hauser)in exchange for his criminal record to be erased. Brian agrees but only if he is given permission to choose his partner. Brian heads home to Barsto, Arizona where he recruits an old friend Roman Pearce (Tyrese) to help him. Pearce agrees but only for the same deal Brian was offered. With the help of Monica, Brian and Rome work together to take down Verone. This was a horrible movie. There was no reason to make a sequel. They should have stopped after the first one.",164
1,An excellent hair regrowth product,"I have now used the product for about six weeks and I am more than satisfied with what I see. It is however important to mention the fact that I did combine this with biotin tablets (maximum strenght). If you have hair regrowth issues like I do, this is the best solution to use, at least based on my experience BUT at the same time combine this with biotin maximum strenght. This is what I am doing right now and getting excellent results. You get both products at AMAZON markets place at excellent prices.Thank you",95
0,Supremely disappointed......,"I've been a major fan of the HP series for many years, and never acquired any of the books in hopes that they would release all of the hardcovers in a set. When I saw back in July that this set was being released I was thrilled. I just received it today, and have already filled out the return form to Amazon. I am HIGHLY disappointed. I am in the Graphics industry, and we would NEVER package something as precious as the novels themselves in something as shoddy as this faux woodgrain file box. Maybe if the publisher receives enough of these back (at $120 each), they'll get the hint. Just watch, six months from now they'll produce a REAL wooden box.... Avoid this!!!",124
0,Sweet Dreams,"Proving that inspiration can strike anywhere, anytime, Claire finds hers scrawled across a bathroom wall. Urged to find a life, she takes off to find her long absent father. Shreveport no longer feels like home since her husband dumped her. However, her destination, Valentine, gives her what she was missing- surrogate relatives from parents to a pregnant teen who needs mothering herself, and an interesting man who is interested in her. Just when life has a more rosy tinge, her cheating ex realizes that she was worth holding onto and how foolish he was to let her get away, making her wonder if the way back is the way forward.Eccentrics give the novel color, much like Steel Magnolias or other Southern chick lit might have. The emails between Claire's surrogate mother and her love interest throw the narrative off a bit, however. It does, to on the positive side, have a good heart to power the story.",157

The music is fantastic. Not since the emergence of all those bands from Seatle on the early 90's have I heard such a great band. Thay have a very unique sound. It would be unfair to compare these guys to other bands but, if you like the sounds of The Beatles, U2, Radiohead, Live and others like them, you'll definately love The Kidneythieves. The lyrics are deep, the guitar ripps, the drums rattle away like a thunderstorm and the bass is REAL GOOD! Great Sound great show, watch for these guys in the future.

0,Terminator with wings,"My title sums it up. I wanted to like this film, angels, great effects, violence and only a thread of a plot, normally I do like movies that are heavy on the action even if they only have the bare wish of a plot. This one? I kept feeling like I'd seen this story before, it had wings and angels instead of cyborg assassins from a distant future. God instead of a computer program trying to stop the resistance from happening, but at the end, it was Terminator with wings. And not done nearly as well. With the mythology to draw on, with the possible conflict available, it failed to live up to it's effects.The effects were good, but instead of being as creepy as it could have been, it was just gross in parts. The caricatured charactures kept it from ever becoming the scary look at a possible apocalypse it could have been. It just never seemed to quite make it clearly into one genre or another, and failed at all of them.",174

1,"An enjoyable, non-stop action read.","This was my first adventure into the world of Robert McCammon, and a fun one at that. The wolf's hour tells the tale of Michael Gallatin, a werewolf who is also a spy for the allies during World War II. Mr. McCammon intertwines two stories at once, the WWII part as well as the story of how Michael grew up and became a werewolf. This second story was my favorite part of the book. Mr. McCammon portrays the emotions of the characters so vividly that you can almopst feel the pain every time the ""change"" overcomes Michael and you really get a sense of the internal struggle between man and wolf. This is one of those books where suspense lurks sround every corner and the action never lets up. My only beefs are that 1)near the end, the author seems to rush the story and 2)the ending could have been a bit better. Even so, I still gave it 4 stars since the rest of the book was simply awesome.",170

0,"another Carrey movie, but not the best","Jim Carrey is doing well in the funny role as usual, however this movie is not the best Carrey movie. It is long, or maybe too hollow, or maybe the pace is too slow. At the same time it focusses on just one, rather small place (Lawson), and the time frame is also short . Also there are some political undertones which I could not really always understand. As to the characters, they are are not too ""live"" actually (probably due to the amnesia that stikes Peter/Luke); I was not really impressed by Peter Appleton, Harry Trimble, Irene Teriwilliger, Emmit Smith, Sandra Saint-Clair, Adele Stanton and Lucille Angström Ichtville.

Her characters have texture and complexity even though they seem to follow a formula.After you've read a few of McKillip's works you'll find few surprises in the rest of her collection.

0,Disappointing...,"I have struggled to get along with my boyfriend's parents for the past year and, having read the positive reviews on the cover, had strong hopes that this book would offer some insight into how I could make things better with them.I think that calling this book a ""how-to"" guide is misleading. This is mainly a collection of anecdotes from a variety of ""in-laws"". About 70% of these stories are about positive in-law relationships. The author merely strings these stories together and at the end of each chapter offers a small paragraph or two of vaguely-defined, common-sense suggestions.If you are looking for some real life stories that you can relate to, you may enjoy this book. But if you are having real difficulties with your in-laws or prospective in-laws, this book offers little solid advice or insight.",137
1,Sci-fi-martial arts,"To be honest I much prefer seeing Jet Li kicking ... in a more ancient China setting (ie. ""Twin Warriors""). I must also add that I'm not a Sci-fi fan however Jet Li being the martial artist that he is won me over. He plays a double role of good guy vs. bad guy. Although he was a bad guy in Lethal Weapon 4 the brand he portrayed in ""The One"" is much different and shows another side of Jet Li's talents. If you enjoy seeing him kick ... then you'll enjoy watching ""The One""",95
0,Shocking,"I read this book about a month ago and I'm still in shock at how terrible it was. I normally don't critique people's writing styles but come on, this was so horribly written that I could barely finish it. I can't believe it was actually published...and even more that some people like it. Also, I think the author is a little out of touch with the younger generation-what kind of high school party plays Celine Dion music? Really. I actually don't ever write reviews on books either but this was so terrible I felt compelled to save someone from wasting their money.",102

I'm not a heavy user, and yet it would stop working every couple of months or so. By trial and error I figured out that to revive it, I needed to remove the batteries, wait a few seconds and put them back in, then re-sync. Then finally it seems to have completely failed just now, after about 18 months. I can't revive it anymore. I find it unacceptable for modern electronics to fail so quickly.",82
1,First in the Series...,"The House of the Dead (sometimes called Curien Mansion) series is amazingly awesome. Although this game is simple and graphic, every Saturn owner should have it, and if you own the Stunner or Light Gun for the Saturn, it just makes the experience more awesome! Warning: It's hard to find for a decent price, and they didn't make any remake like they did for the second one and the third one. This is the only version you can find of House of the Dead. Although it's a great game, it's not worth $50, so don't fall for the pricey claims.",100
1,Literature and Entertainment!!!!!,"This book possesses something very rare: the ability to entertain as well as just about any Agathe Christie book along with a wildly rich variety of diction, intrigue, and (though the author denies it in his prologue) meaning. I have read it three times and each time I chuckle over some droll detail I missed on my last reading. Moreover, a great introduction to Nabokov: Ada and Pale Fire require much more cerebral work, and unlike Despair, don't lend themselves as easily to being happily re-read - something pretty much required if Nabokov can begin to be truly appreciated, as his stylings are difficult. A wild romp that will particularly be appreciated by worshippers of Dostoevsky and Pushkin, as critical extensions of some of their work are oddly offered (and strangely juxtaposed)as well. A solid, muscular masterpiece that makes much of Lolita look tame.",144
1,Overall good information...,"Dr. Vanheemst does a great job giving the facts to the situation. The first couple of chapters are a list of facts it seems, but he makes a lot of good points in the midst of them. Overall, its a good read if you are interested in school choice.",49

What you would expect from Disney.,72

They were like what the hell is this. One sip and one of them was ready to vomit.

1,Fun Read,"""Something Borrowed"" is the tale of Rachel: dutiful daughter, loyal best friend, kick ass laywer who happens to realize she's in love with her best friend's fiance. Obviously anyone reading this has already read the synopsis, so I won't bore you with that AGAIN. The one thing that I want to impress upon anyone considering this book is JUST DO IT. It is well written, the characters are well developed and fun, and you will not be able to put it down! Great to take to the beach or on vacation. I'm currently reading the sequel (""Something Blue"") and it is equally as fun so far! Looking forward to checking out Giffin's other books as well!",116
0,Disappointed,"I purchased this set because the idea of a countersink, with a correctly sized tapered pilot hole in one step seems like a time saver. The set delivers on these points as long as you don't need to move the countersink towards the tip to accommodate a shorter screw. The set screws that hold the countersink in place have very little to take purchase on when it is moved onto the flutes of the drill bit. Thus, the countersink has both slipped and wobbled. This set will go in the trash when I receive the 3pc Pro Countersink Set from Rockler. This system uses a much longer sleeve between the countersink and the drill bit allowing you to move the drill within the sleeve and having adequate purchase for the set screws of the countersink.",135

And boy am I glad I ever did.The amazing intensity just smacks you in the face, and boy this is some solid stuff. I love the speed, and it's not just mindless speed, it all has some sort of musicality in terms of the actual song which makes it 20x better.Without a doubt pick this up if you are any sort of fan of Power/Speed/Guitar in general and you will not be disappointed.I'm off to go purchase Dragonforce's other two albums!",145

Little did I know this version wasn't an unabridged reading--not even an abridged reading, it was rubbish that was painful to the ears.In this audio version there about 4 or 5 people, some male, some female, and after every sentence one of them read, overlapping the other. So it goes something like this:Guy: [The guy sat there looking at the birds]Now, as soon as he started saying ""birds"" a female would kick in with the next sentence.Female: [the birds were acting strange]then another guythen somebody elseTHE WHOLE WAY THROUGH!It was so bad, after listening to less than 2 minutes of it, I packed it up, and sent it back.

0,a big disappointment,"This book should probably be called ""gated communities"" rather than ""hidden homes"" - the homes photographed are the super-expensive vacation retreats of people who only live in the area periodically. These interiors are the work of professional designers, static ""museum spaces"" for the art collections of movie producers and ex-fashion models. The book is sadly lacking in the integrity and spirit of the people who actually live in the area, where a distinctive architectural and decorative style has evolved over thousands of years of human habitation.It would be a pleasure to see a book about northern New Mexico houses that are designed, built, or lovingly restored by people who actually live in the area.",114

1,not for the younger toddler,"I started really urine training my daughter at 17 months (and had her doing BM on the toilet at a year). While this book had tons of information for the later trainer, there was not much at all for the younger child, other than the typical list of ""readiness signs"". I still give it four stars because if my daughter were maybe 3 or 4 years old, this book would be invaluable. There is lots of information on how to motivate an older child, how to deal with particular problems and temporary setbacks, etc. It does not give one definite ""way"" to train, but rather suggests many possible routes along the way and emphasizes that each child is different and will be more or less successful depending on the route. If you're starting at an earlier age, I'd look somewhere else. My child has all the readiness signs, but is not old enough to be motivated by ""pretty panties"" or ""friends at preschool"", nor is old enough to give me major temper tantrums or refusal to go.",177

I had to sit with the awful smell under my nose for three minutes. I finally got to wipe it off and the hair was gone, so I figured that was that. Then it started to burn and turn bright red.

I just think he underestimates how MANY people would be dissatisfied with this superficial society, and that they would get together and conspire to cause a revolution. Still, it was very well written and entertaining, and made me think long and hard, which any good book will do.",121

I only used to about two months and had to change the batteries about 6 times. Even with fresh batteries sometimes the music won't play, or the light for the stars wouldn't come on.

0,Go back to school,"No reputable historian ever uses the term ""Dark Ages"" since this is an inaccurate and pejorative term for a period in which art and learning were thriving in Byzantium and many places in western Europe (Ireland, for instance). Moreover, anyone who places Van Eyck in the Middle Ages is simply an ignoramous and should not be passing him/herself off as an expert on any aspect of history. It may be that these errors do not occur within the DVD under review, but are merely the gaffes of whoever wrote the ""editorial review"". I haven't actually seen ""Landmarks of Western Art"" and the review does not encourage me to do so. I guess this might disqualify me from writing a review, but after all, this is Amazon.com-- since when do reviews have to be written by people who've actually seen the product?!

I think Ms Beranbaum might be the world's most gifted cake/pie/bread maker but she certainly needs a bit of help when it comes to picking a publisher. My 'Cake Bible' fell apart very quickly as the pages couldn't wait to detach themselves from the feeble spine. This has not happened to my pie bible coz as I said, I've never used it.

1,As a first time reader,"As a first time reader the book was well written. I love historical romance and the issues it entails. I liked how possessive Brandon was with Heather from the beginning. His loyalty and faithfulness to Heather was refreshing considering he only slept with her one night. Their nemesis Louisa which was Brandon 's ex-fiancee spiteful comments were believable. However, I gave it a 4 star because was way to meek and shy for my taste. She needs backbone to handle a handsome rugged hunk like Brandon. Although, I'll give Heather credit for getting one in the end. Also, I think Kew could of expanded on the sex scenes instead of starting with he kissed her neck with heart beating fast then ending it there. So for you reader's out there if your into romance with a plot and adventure this will be a good read. But if you looking dreamy love scenes forget it look some where else.",158

My food processor has a citrus juicer and an extractor on it, so I didn't want to have another big electrical item to pull out for just a simple glass of juice.

Percy Faith and Montovani are perhaps best remebered for this genre of music - Beautiful or Easy Listening Music, which changed into something else by the late-70s. Some of the songs here were played on the two beautiful music stations in Chicago, which my father played daily.King of Kings is a good addition to add value to the CD.My favorites are:Theme From 'Elvira Madigan', Theme From 'The Mercenaries', This Is My Song From 'A Countess From Hong Kong', I Will Wait For You From 'The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg', Irina From 'Shalako',A Man And A Woman, and Love Theme From 'Ben Hur'.I am grateful that Dutton Vocalion brought these recordings back.

The book spends way too much time on furniture and the second half of the book is all 'practice appraisals' which are for objects the average person will never buy or be able to afford. I felt like this book had a certain 'snob' appeal and if you can afford to buy a $5000 or $10,000 piece you probably have enough knowledge without having to consult a book.

1,"Matthew, Robinson Crusoe, Moby Dick, and The Tempest","The opening reflection of Geoff Wood's Living Lectionary centers around the Old Testament reading for the First Sunday of Advent, in which Isaiah speaks of beating swords into plowshares. Wood recalls looking a the ruins of the World Trade Center and finding a renewed appreciation for ""all construction in human nature,"" everything from the Golden Gate Bridge to ""the long series of people who, when I flip a switch, flood my home with light and warmth."" Links to Life and Literature is filled with such personal observations as well as connections to literature. For example, Matthew's account of Jesus' baptism is tied to scenes in Robinson Crusoe, Moby Dick, and The Tempest. This refreshing approach to the Year A readings is especially effective in bringing the scriptures to life in twenty-first century America.",133

1,Jesus Dynasty,"Well worth reading if true this would stand Christianity on its head .How would the Vatican react to this ? they would have to re-think and restructure their Dogma. or go out of Business they have covered up the true Family History of Jesus for almost 2000 yrs. Its time for them to make a Good Confession. St Paul Stated People are fools who Believe Jesus Rose from the Dead in Body.He went on to say Jesus arose in spirit. because the body was only a Garment that Decays in Death. & there was no place for a Human Body in the Kingdom of Heaven .I'don't agree with everything in this book, but i will rate it as five stars .R.P.C",121
0,The hugest piece of junk I ever bought!,"This phone had absolutely no redeeming qualities! None of the buttons worked properly and when I called the manufacturer the French Canadian customer service girl hung up on me before stating; ""If you bought the phone from some unknown company like Amazon, you deserve to keep it, I never heard of Amazon Too bad for you if it doesn't work."" Nice customer service ""manager"" she told me she was the manager when I tried to call back to complain about her. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY AND PASS THE WORD. Amazon should discontinue selling their products as well.",98
0,Rip-off junk,This system made our discs totally unusable. We had to throw them away. What more can I say!,18
0,Waste of Time!,This book is a waste of time! It is very difficult to understand because of the manner in which it is written. There is a lot of information that is just useless and it is very boring to attempt to get through it!,43
0,A literary triumph... I can't wait until the movie comes out,"This might be the best book any elitist, intolerant, bigot has ever written. It has it all. It tells you how to live, what to believe, and even what is wrong and right. It is my hope that this book will be in classrooms everywhere someday. Students should just burn all history and biology books and read this book over and over again until it has completely brainwashed them.",69
0,Windup Galatic Robot,The Galatic Robot Windup by Toysmith was a disappointment. It was damaged and could not windup. Why would a seller send a toy that does not work to a child? The only reason I did not return the toy to the seller is that the shipping costs cost more than this toy. I will not buy another tyoy from Toysmith.,60
0,Why Did you do it to your self? Why?,"Have you ever heard the saying that when something is good, leave it alone? Well Mr. Omar R. Tyree did the exact oppisite, ""Flyy Girl"" a perfectly good book, and he destroyed it, completly missed it up. Sometimes things don't need a sequel just leave it alone, yet he did it anyway, Tracy growing up is not what people wanted to read about, especially when she lived a life of 30 grown women when she was younger in ""Flyy Girl"" so what more could she have possibly experienced.",88
0,Complaint,"I ordered this product from Amazon.com and was very excited to get this in, set it up, had problems and called Linksys. I was told that this product does not support AOL, and to go with another model. This will probably be the last Linksys product I buy",48
1,Sleeper Combo Set,"For the dollars this is a great buy. Case, flashlight, 2 batteries and fast charger for not too much money. Don't forget it comes with a nice drill too. The controls are easy to reach and it is light weight and well balanced. ...",44
1,great cd by the offspring,"this cd has some good punk songs on it. the songs all i want, cool to hate, way down the line, and mota rule. me and my old lady is a weird song. is he talking about his mom in that song? well this cd has the coolest songs.",49
1,"good packaging, but what about Dave Abbruzzese?","I thought this was a pretty good set, however I think a few things are missing from the unplugged show though. My only real complaint about the set is the fact that on the dvd it only shows Eddie, Stone, Jeff and Mike on the dvd menu, what about Dave Abbruzzese? I kinda thought that was pretty rude, he was an awesome drummer and had a lot of input in the band.I noticed they also blanked him on the photos contained in rearview mirror (the best of) Anyway the remix cd was cool and it was awesome to see unplugged on dvd even if it has been cut.",108
1,worked at 1st,"I think this product works great but its effectiveness seemed to wear off with our dog after a week or two . . . not sure that's the fault of the gadget, tho. And the price is certainly right.",39
1,Its worth the money!,I got this to track down cat 5 wires in a office. It is easy to use and very accurate! It will narrow it down to the right wire 9 out of 10 times. The 1 time i could not narrow it down to one it was one of the two that it said it was. This tool now used on all my IT calls and will be for years to come!,72
0,palm wifi,"Disappointed with this product. The first thing is its excessive need for power, battery life used up in less than 15 minutes!!. Secondly, is the screen resolution with the webpro browser that comes with the palm tungsten T3 is very deficient. A lot of things with graphics will not come up, and the screen even with its unique option to expand the screen, still is very inadequate. Unfortunately I have alredy bought 2, one for myself and my wife's T3. Looking to see if it can be sold back somehow.",90
0,Amateur Hour Extreme,"This is perhaps the most amateurish movie I've ever seen. It's so ridiculously bad, that I had a hard time believing it was released on DVD. Horrible sound, bad acting, stupid story lines.......no redeeming fun at all. As far as being a kids film....it's too lame for that. Stupidity does not mean kids will like it. Stay away!",58
1,The Soundtrack--They Don't Make 'Em Like They Used To,"This is a great movie; the reviewer from the New York Times above obviously watched a different movie than most of America. Anyway, one of the absolute best things about this movie is the soundtrack. You have Harry Connick, Jr. and Jimmy Durante, among several others, singing those timeless songs they just don't sing anymore.I'm a romantic big time, and there's just something about a love story with Nat King Cole singing ""Stardust"" at just the right moment to make a big marshmallow out of me.",86
0,Don't bother,We got this for Christmas.The battery charger will not work with game boy color. We hardley ever use the light. This is a waste of money unless you have a regular game boy.,33
0,Christian Propaganda Fails Despite Author's Skill and Talent,"Despite her genuine skill and talent, Anne Perry has hit a solid thud with ""Tathea,"" an obvious name in itself, 'Ta-Thea' indicating a connection with God (theo, thea being the Greek word for God, masculine and feminine). I am very sorry that this was my first Anne Perry book for it has put me off her work forever, I'm afraid. It is pure preachment and succeeds only as a work of Christian propaganda. It turned me off, even with its display of wan tolerance towards other religious viewpoints, as it assumes a superiority of origin. I believe it is revealing and that Perry has written what, for her, represents something deeply personal and genuine, but which, for me, and I'm sure for others, represents something despotically religious. Ultimately, it fails as literature because it has a clear agenda behind the story.",141
1,A lot of good ideas,"This book had a lot of good natural magic ideas, and I enjoyed flipping through it. Not only is it good to read front to back, but also to dip into to pick out ideas. The chapters are well separated, which is great for finding what you need.The magic in this book is natural, beautiful and back to basics. Nothing over ceremonial, which I like.",65
1,Even A Lug Like Me Can Bake,"Baking always seemed impossible to me - I'd be lucky to get anything to rise, my food would always weigh a ton and, basically, unless someone really loved me, they probably wouldn't eat more than a couple bites. But with Baking for Dummies, all that has changed. I now whip out cupcakes, breadsand pastry with ease. I can't say enough about the handy tips that the author includes, I've found them extremely useful with other recipies as well. I'm fattening up my office mates with the bounty from my oven and finding that there is great piece of mind in baking.",101
1,Indispensable!,"I bought this little book back in college, but started using it again recently on a temp job as an Executive Assistant for a CEO. Simply put, it's the best, most concise guide for grammar, style and punctuation that I've come across. Now I use it whenever I write business letters, personal letters and my own creative writing. It makes a wonderful quick guide if you're in a hurry, but also gives plenty of examples to flesh out the do's and don'ts. Many people today don't know how to write well, but the amount of guidebooks out there is downright intimidating. The Little English Handbook is well written, easy to understand, unpretentious, and actually makes you want to learn more about how to use the English language properly. Now you'll know when to use semicolons, how to avoid awkward sentences, and what the heck a conjunctive adverb is! This handbook should be on everyone's bookshelf.",155
1,Different pace of film,"Read the reviews that rate it 4 or 5 stars, you'll get more detail than I will provide. This was a first-time viewing for me, so I was partially intrigued, but not disappointed. I rated it 4 stars, not that it couldn't be 5, there just lacked a touch of logical progression for me. The Bogie/Bacall combo is there, more subdued than their other notable performances - To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep, Key Largo. In watching the special features, and learning some behind the scenes info, helped explain some of the ""cheap"" feel some segments had, for me anyway. Least enjoyable character was the grifter, he just lacked a bit for me. All of the others were solid, enjoyable to watch in action. One amusing point was Bogarts observation about how Warner would feel about paying him all that money, for what amount he was seen, too rich!",151
1,Saving Jane - Girl Next Door,"Wow what can I say - this is definitely a cd that you need to purchase. Marti, lead vocals, has a unique voice that can remind some of Avril Levine, combined with Sheryl Crow.....and also how about those boys - some awesome eye candy!!!! Happy - love the song - every girl can relate - Sleep on it- well it's on my top list of favorite songs....each song is something that someone can relate too! pick up this cd and be glad you did!",84
1,Better Than the Other name brand,I'm a repeat customer because my family likes this product. The price on Amazon is good. I would recommend everyone give it a try!,24
0,I've tried to like this for 13 years,"Except for ""Everlong,"" most of the music here just doesn't stick in your head. It all sounds the same: ferocious guitars, pounding drums, urgent vocals. And yet, no tunes. ""Everlong,"" though, is a beaut.",34
1,great game!,This is a fun game to enjoy with the family or friends. You can be involved in easy conversation and play at the same time.,25
0,Steals the beauty of art,"Like speaking with a doctor, not a fun book, very very interesting information done boring.",15
0,Not worth it,"This album is way overproduced and the performance lacks emotion for the most part, especially the vocals, which is one of my favorite things about this band. It's just bad. I bought the double CD special edition, and after I listened to the first disc, which is the studio album, I almost went and returned it. Then I listened to the bonus disc, which is demos of all the songs. It was SOOOO much better. The writing is better, the production is better, and the performance has so much mor energy. I showed the difference to 3 other people and they all agreed that the demos were better. I don't know what the band members were thinking, but they should have released something more like thte demos. The studio album sounds like generic bad pop rock, whereas the demos sound like good music. So, if you are thinking about getting this album, just go for the double cd bonus one.",160
0,What a disapointment,"I consider myself a big star wars fan, and I wish I didn't waste my money on this DVD. The hype on this is very over rated. All the news on the deleted sense being so great. They were ok but the better ones of course were on the second disk and not part of the movie at all. Who was the idiot that decided that one? I don't know about anyone else but I buy DVD's to see the deleted sense during the movie not separate! Save your money. It's not worth it unless you are a die-hard fan but even then be prepared to be disappointed.",108
1,Great tool!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a great addition to the tool I already have. It will make trimming sooooo much easier. Great quality product.,21
1,Good Product,"The product itself is indeed very refreshing - it's like washing your face with orange juice!The only reason I didn't give it five stars (as I did in my first review) is because, after giving it such high marks, the pump began leaking. Every time I pumped, the soap poured through the pump plunger, all over the container and then all over the bathroom counter. Very disappointing. I'm ordering again with the hope that it was just a fluke.",79
0,"Who likes these idiots, not us toads!","Toro: Say Pancho(laughing), Green Day named an album after themselves, the stupido Maricone Idiots! Pancho: Si Toro, anyone who gives these fake punks a 5 star are ridiculous. Toro: Pancho, the lead singer's name is Billie Joe, I think he is either a hermaphrodite or a redneck(laughs). Pancho: Toro, he is loco in the cabasah. Toro: Songs like the title track, Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Wake Me Up When September Ends prove these guys only care about money and not their fans. Pancho: These loco gringos had to jump on Bush-bashing kick to resuscitate their sagging career. Toro: Anyone who is loving these gringos are stupido, BAMINOS from this PRONTO!",111

1,Vtech-Tote'N Go Laptop Plus,"Vtech-Tote 'N Go Laptop Plus is great for my 4 and 7 year olds. It teaches Alphabet, Numbers, and other fun games. I'll be using it for years. It's nice to have a lap top toy for children to learn on.",41
0,Not Worth The Money or The Time,"A dime store ""novel"", at best, which, after reading a few pages, I realized was not anything close to a real book. Should not have been represented as a new Tom Clancy novel and certainly should not have had the promotional references to character development on the back cover. Repetetive passages about perfect submarine kills with no true represetation of realities of life at sea, maintenance or weapons problems. I fault the bookstore for displaying it as a Tom Clancy novel, and I fault Tom Clancy for not clearly labelling this as NOT a novel.",95
0,Don't Buy Refurbished,"I bought the refurb version of this player, and am sorry that I did. The tray on the first one wouldn't close all the way. The second one (yea, silly me...)wouldn't play, and the turntable wouldn't turn. Both times, this was right out of the box. I'm out $30 for having to ship these back. I guess that I'll have to repair my 15 year old Sony.",67
1,When The Best Isn't Enough,"Before starting a major macro project, I purchased this book and ""VB & VBA In a NutShell"". What VBA language knowledge I possessed beforehand I had gathered from hither and yon and by experimenting with Word. This book was fundamental to understanding the object model and to understanding many specific areas (bookmarks, find and replace, section breaks, to name a few). However, it is dated and occasionally threadbare. You will still need to gather information from online forums and such to round out your knowledge. I read many reviews here before purchasing and I have no doubt that it is the best book of its kind, but it's still not enough. You will need this book for medium-to-large macro projects, but don't rely upon it exclusively.",126
0,too small,I thought this would be good for my dog but when I got it. It was so tiny. Would be great for a kitten or a small puppy,28
1,Great investment,"This is a great way to invest in woodworking, you get to plane your own boards for an added level of personalization. It would be nice if this unit had two speeds but for the price, it is fantastic. Very little snipe and easy adjustments make planing more enjoyable than some other units. The dust hood needs to be screwed into the cutterhead which is a little obnoxious but once it is attached you don't need to think about it again...until you go to fold the outfeed table back up. Planed over 1000 linear feet of lumber with no problems other than some sawdust sticking to the rollers making them slip. Overall, I'm very happy with the DW764.",118
0,reviewing hot target,This book has to be one of the worst books that I have ever attempted to read. I'm a prolific reader and I found it impossible to maintain any interest . There was no plot that I could see...the writing was sophmoric at best and I had to throw the book in the trash after struggling through about thirty pages. How and why a publisher put this book on the market is a mystery to me.,76
1,Great book...,"I love Grisham's books. I don't think he's written a disappointing one, yet, unlike most authors. Great story with an even better ending. Bravo...",24
0,Worst. Movie. Ever.,"Words cannot capture the awfulness of this movie. The bad acting, flat direction and gimmicky camera shots are overshadowed only by the dreadful script. Until looking it up on IMDB, I was convinced that ""I Me Wed"" was written by a fourteen year old girl. The word trite does not begin to describe it.Yet I agree with the other review. You MUST have this movie in your DVD collection. Put it beside ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and ""Ishtar"". So bad it's good...so bad it's awesome. If only Mystery Science Theatre 3000 was still around and did romantic comedies.",99
0,Not Good for Video Files,"Bought this USB version after happily using a Firewire Lacie external HD for many years. This USB version does not work well with Mac OSX. Some files (in my case, video) will not copy over. The error msg is a ""-50"" error about a problem with the file name. Worse, files that appear to copy successfully are corrupted and won't play.",61

1,CD's Music is a stairway to heaven,"For years to come, I know I will remember the last dances at my Junior High school, when they play Stairway to heaven as the last dance. Everyone, even those considered ""outcasts"" (I always feel bad) wants to dance to the wonderful song. It is the nicest thing that I have ever done, dancing slowly to the perfect, heavenly song with someone I like. Sometimes, I feel like I'm floating away by the guitar solo at the end.",78
0,Just finding equations,"What would really improve this text is if lessons towards the end of the text, chapters 6 and on, included the equations from previous chapters so the reader could get a general understanding of the material needed to the problems in the text.Also, it would be nice if the text included sample problems like the first 20-25 problems at the end of the chapters. Finally, I would like to see calculation of intrinsic amounts of carriers. Every time I do it I get something far from what the text uses in its problems.",93
0,Ugh!!!,"Holy crap! What a stinker! I've seen better films made by junior high students with the old wind up film cameras. I am a huge Barker fan and even loved the ultra cheesy 80s films such as Rawhead Rex and the like, but this one?!?!? Eep! The filming all in negative hurt my eyes, as did the wang-shot. No thanx, man.I don't care if you are a goth, horror buff, OR artsy-fartsy film maker hopeful. It sucked no matter how you slice it. This film (or was it two? Aw who cares) should have been left in the vault.The only good part was the half naked ""Redemtion Films"" vampire chicks, who sort of did the horror host trip at the beginning.I don't know, maybe if you ""dropped"" first you might get what's going on, but even having read the books, it was too ambiguous for me.",146

1,"Cool Music, great value","I bought this disc after attending many of the International pop Overthrow shows in L.A., 2004. A lot of good bands and a lot of crappy ones. But 75% of what made it onto this compilation is good stuff.Nearly all of this music is in the classic guitar driven, vocal harmony, hook laden Beatles-Cheap Trick school of rock and that ain't bad. No, that's quite good, as a matter of fact.For me the standout track is by the Shamus Twins. There's three of them, so how can they calll themselves the Shamus Twins? Anyway, their track is called ""I Hide"", and it has a very modern rock feel to it, though still Beatle-esque.I highly recommend this CD to any rock or pop lover who appreciates song craftsmanship and hooks hooks hooks!",131
0,Disappointed in what could have been a neat toy......,"This toy stopped working in 2 days! Tried new batteries, didn't work. I've written Hasbro asking about returning it.

A little bit of soul.Very far away from ""Planet Earth""As HD DVD, I'm surprised of the low quality of the shooting or the transfert : it look like a poor standard DVD.Over saturated colors, over exposed (whites) instable images, jolts, judder, dirt on the camera lens.

0,Private Practice,Maybe it was the mood I was in but I found this program to be inane. It was recommended as a funny medical show. I felt more like it was a frat movie set in a hospital.,37
0,dissapointed,"I was quite anxious to get the book and start cooking, but when I received the book I was very dissapointed with the book itself. It is not inviting in any sense. I just can not believe that there are only handful of pictures of the respices in the book. I guess it is just more important to get, I don't know, several books out in one year rather than doing one professionally. Cooking is something of a special field of ""science"" and a well made cookbook with appropriate pictures will not only give one that preliminary ""taste"" of the recipe but the visual connections makes your mouth water. Afterall, a picture can describe thousand words.The recipes provided are nothing spectacular either. I was expecting much more. Too many burgers for one thing.",133
0,Could have been a TV episode!,"Being a huge X-Files fan I am very disappointed. The first movie was great and I'm sure the X-Filers were eager for the long awaited 2nd feature film but Chris Carter and the production team blew it on this one. Everything about this movie could have been done in a regular TV episode. Not big screen material. What happened to the aliens and unexplained phenomenon? I had to keep from falling asleep during most of the movie. I cant even say it was worth the rental but it was nice to see Fox and Dana together again. I would have given it one star but just to see these two in the same feature together and the fact that I always liked the X-Files, I'll give it a weak two stars.",131
1,innocent kids' book,"I remember doing a book report on Alice and the Boa Constrictor in the fourth grade. It was a cute book suitable for both males and females, about a fickle little girl who decides one day that she wants a snake and gets one. I hated snakes as a kid and still do, but this is a very charming book.",60
0,The Wizard of OZ??,"This is a very well-done recording but it doesn't come close to matching the magic of Judy Garland, Ray Bloger, Bert Lahr, or Jack Haley. For me this isn't the ""real"" Wizard of Oz. Please buy the cd with the classic voices instead of this remake!",46
0,Don't get your hopes up,"I was excited to find a crockpot cookbook that didn't have lots of recipes with cream of mushroom soup in them. Some recipes are written more clearly than others. Some have a range for how long you should cook stuff instead of a particular number.I tried 3 recipes. First was a Rosemary Chicken recipe which cooked the chicken too long and dried it out. Then I tried a macaroni and cheese recipe which burnt. Finally I tried a recipe for chicken with soy sauce and honey which once again was dried out. The seasonings were good and some of the recipes were pretty unique, hence the 2 star rating.I followed the directions to the letter and even had the same size crockpot which they mentioned in the recipe!So if you choose to use this book, watch the food VERY CLOSELY.",140

1,Rowenta DG5030 Pressure Iron and Steamer,"When I say the lady on the T.V. advertising this item, I thought she must be joking because she said something like the following: ""I hated ironing and now I love it"". Well, I came to find out that this is true. I bought this item because I only needed to use the steamer portion of it more than the ironing, because I hate ironing. NOW, I FIND THAT I CANNOT WAIT TO IRON OR STEAM MY FAMILY'S COTHING! BUY IT! It will change the way you look at doing laundry. By-the-way, it also cuts my time in More than half.Happy Ironing!A.

Anyone else having problems synching the unit with a toshiba laptop?,57
0,Stick with the first 'Speed'!,"This is not a good movie. It has bad editing, horrible script, bad action-sequences, dumb-villian, hammy acting, except for Sandra Bullock who's playing herself in a surprisingly annoying way. Nothing seems to be right here. The only thing worth-wile is the final resort-crushing sequence. Rent it first. If you like Sandra Bullock I recommend 'Speed', if you like Jason Patric I recommend 'After Dark My Swet, and if you like Willem Dafoe I recommend 'Platoon' or 'The English Patient'. From a scale of 1-10 I give it a 3.",89

1,what happens next?,"I finished this in 2 days, reading every chance I had. Since this was based on the author's own family, I knew that there must be more information. Even though he gave some information about what happened to his ancestors, I would like to have more information based on his genealogy. Knowing about this family, I care about what happened to them. How did this affect the other children? Mr. Pope alludes to the effect on the family through the generations--having to be better than good. I finished the book weeks ago & still find myself thinking about the family & wondering, what happened next?",105
0,If you loved the first movie do yourself a favor and don't watch this !!!,I consider Boondock Saints (the first movie) one of my top five flicks. Like many others I could not way to see All saints day.... I wish I would have.This was the biggest piece of rat turd I have ever seen. EVERYTHING was wrong with this film here's a breif list to startThe acting was terribleSean Patrick Flannery has you guessing if its really him do to some TERRIBLE plastic surgery (no joke I checked the back of the DVD 3 times to make sure and am still sketchy about it)The script - embarrassingThe music - HorriblePlot- there was one?This movie sucked 5 minutes in and continued straight to the end .Seriously I can't believe this movie is allowed to exist. I also can't believe that it was the same director and actors as the first.I cannot express how awful this film was . PLEASE if you loved the first movie DO NOT WATCH this it will ruin it for you.,161
0,Such a disappointment from such great actors!,"OK as a freebie Sunday night made for TV movie. Not worth renting, let alone buying this one. Just goes to show that the names alone do not a movie make.Not much of a story -- ho hum characters -- predictable ending. What a combination for a bomb. A truly forgettable movie. Nothing stands out except that it was somewhat like Sleepless in Seattle.It's supposed to be a romantic comedy. So where's the romance and the comedy? It was more of a story about good friends who cybercommunicate on an intimate level, but have not formally met.Interesting story but not interesting enough to make a full length movie about. A half-hour episode would suffice. Maybe Tom and Meg should consider a weekly TV sitcom and leave the movies to someone else.",131

0,Misled and Disappointed,"I purchased this kit because I wanted to put a label on a DVD I made. There was nothing in the accompanying online blurb which indicated that it would work only with Windows. So I, a confirmed Mac man, found that the mounting disk would open, but I could not make it work properly. The stock on which the disc blanks and spines were imprinted seemed very heavy, but the adhesive-backed portion worked OK using the round plastic mounting device in the kit. PhotoShop made me a form that matched the printed position of the labels and I filled it in with my own design. None of the designs provided on the disk of the kit met my needs, and in any event I am not sure that I could have transferred them to PhotoShop.",135
1,Definitely the best from Oasis,"What else is there to say? Before all the commercial success, unnecessary hype and unhealthy agitation around the band, this little gem rocked my stereo. Much less Beatles-influenced than their second album this one is also much more electric, filled with Noel's pentatonic solos, repetitive but fun, and cool seventies-sounding riffs. Anyhow, in my opinion, Oasis hasn't been able to surpass this LP yet and probably won't ever be able to. Start your collection here.",75
1,Excellent in the pool,"I bought this floating lounge chair for myself, but my husband has taken it over. He loves to be able to float around (sitting upright) in our pool and drink his beer while the world passes him by! It is well-made and very comfortable. It's great deal through Amazon.com with their free shipping. I just may get another one!",59
0,Frustrating,"This book, though containing some useful strategies, is riddled with errors, and contradictions. After taking a test and reviewing answers, some explanations basically say ""these four answers are wrong for these reasons and it's obvious that the last is correct."" Having a tremendous amount of formal logic in my background, I can tell you in many cases they are WRONG. I have the seond edition and you'll notice, for example, in the explanation for quesiton 10 on page 99 there is a blatant contradiction between the explanation for answer B and for answer D. B states Cartier-Bension is NOT confrontational (and is the basis for their answer), where D states his relationship WAS confrontational! Huh? Did they proofread??!!The furstration endured with this book is severe and the questions seem harder (and more vauge) than on any other REAL LSAT I've seen. If anything, practicing on harder questions will make LSAT day a snap.The strategies are this book's only saving grace.",160

1,Fabulous Euro Sounding Synth,"The synth power machine called Cosmicity (AKA Mark Nicholas)creates some of the best underground synth music available. Smooth and polished, catchy lyrics, and great mixing are all put into every album. You can't ask for much more than this.This album contains two of his classics Too Far Gone and Orange. Both songs that will beg to be replayed. This is one of his more emotional moments in his vast discology. Perfect for driving or just listening while alone but not one of his ""upbeat dance"" albums. If you like the Pet Shop Boys album 'Nightlife' this will rightfully take a respected place in your collection!",105
0,FIX TO WHY COLLAR DOESNT WORK AFTER COUPLE MONTHS,"I FIGURED OUT HOW TO FIX THE COLLAR WHEN THE COLLAR DOES NOT RESPOND EVEN AFTER PUTTING IN NEW BATTERIES.OPEN THE CASE AND REMOVE THE BATTERY HOUSING. THEN TAKE A BUTTER KNIFE AND DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THECIRCUIT BOARD IS A LITTLE METAL ARM, GENTLY PRY THE ARM UPWARD SO IT MAKES BETTER CONTACT WITH THE BATTERIESIN THE HOUSING. THIS IS MY SECOND COLLAR AND WAS PRETTY FRUSTRATED THAT IT NEVER WORKED AFTER A FEW MONTHS.NOW IT DOES! THIS IS A GREAT DEVICE FOR MY CAT WHO LIKES TO URINATE IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE HOUSE. WORKS GREAT!!!! NOW THAT I FIXED IT I WILL GIVE THIS ITEM 5 STARS!!!!!",111

1,"5,000 stars wouldn't be enough","I bought this CD one week after it came out in '96. It didn't come out of my stereo for almost a month. I have loved TON from before the Carnivore days. I would follow them down any road. Oct. Rust is simple genious music, it truely looks into the pits of human thought and desire. I will own World Coming Down on Sept 21. I would never wait when buying a band like Type O Negative. Oct Rust will not dissapoint anyone!!!!!",83
1,a good challenge,"I was introduced to this book through an anatomy class for a high school course. This book is definetly not for the casual anatomy student. The book has so much detail it is overwhelming but it is very helpful in forcing you to apply and learn the material. It definetly gets you allong the course, plus who doesnt like to color.",61
1,Better than Average,"Lets not carried away. This is not a great movie. Its 1961 predecessor was. This is a film for those who are curious to know what happened to Mr. 'fast' Eddy Felson. The script is good, whatever our 3* friend may think, and the performances are certainly assured. But this movie isn't as enduring as The Hustler, and you will grow more tired of it than you would think possible on first view. The portrait of hustling is laughably unrealistic, and the ending dire, but there is sufficient empathy with characters, in spite of a slightly unneccesary love triangle, to ensure emotional involvement. If you like pool watch this. If you like cinema watch The Hustler.",116
0,An interesting but dangerous book...,"I feel sorry for the poker novice that buys this book and sits in a low limit game using the ""theories"" presented here. The style of play illustrated is much too aggressive for the average player especially at a low-limit table where many players will stay to see the flop regardless of what they're holding. It does, however, contain some interesting stories about Phil's own exploits. If you want to learn more about Phil Hellmuth, this is a good book. If you want to learn to play poker, there are many better reads.",93
0,Terrible Movie,"I was tempted to dump this movie several times. The dialogue, particularly in the trial is not realistic. The jury verdict in no way reflects the evidence. Everything about this silly movie was predictble and boring.Just not worth watching. I'm not certain why I gave it two stars.",48
1,Outstanding overview of recent Korean history,Anyone who wants to brush up on the issues surrounding North and South Korea would do well to pick up this volume. It is well written and actually enjoyable to read. You will also pick up a lot of historical tidbits from the era from the author who was actually there as a reporter. Especially interesting were his observations of North Korea made during a trip there.,67
1,Nothing Compares To You.,"Sinead's first two cds are her best. I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got (IDNWWIHG) is a classic with the hits ""Nothing Compares 2 U"" and ""The Emperor's New Clothes"" with non-hit classics like ""Three Babies"" and ""Black Boys on Mopeds"" Sinead proved that she was a force to be reckoned with. This cd is a must have for any rock collector. One of the greatest singers of all time.",71

1,Great for Starters,"I have had this camera since October 2003 and I'm very satisfied with it. It's my first digital camera and got it for a great price (considering its features). It is compact and it doesn't consume a lot of power. The image quality is good. I'm no professional photographer, so I mostly e-mail my pics or take the card to somplace and have the pics printed.There's no escape: you have to read the manual & get to know the camera . The controls are handy and you can say that it is a point-and-shoot product.Outdoor pictures with plenty of light are excellent. Can't say the same about night shots. They tend to come out dark and blurry (at least with the auto mode on).Bottomline: This camera is a great choice for non-professionals and starters.",134
0,Not Like Garret PI series,I am a huge fan of Glen Cook's Garrett PI stories. I really disliked Tower of Fear because it tried to tell about the adventure from several protagonist viewpoints. It's almost like he's trying to write an episode of the world he portrays as opposed to one person's adventure. It does add a lot of pages to the book if he is being paid by page.,66
1,Great all purpose case,"Affords very good protection and is great looking too. Belt clip is secure but doesn't add a lot of thickness and the flip secures via a magnetic clip. The charge port is inaccessible while in the case, but I don't find it to be a particular hardship to slip it out of the case. I prefer having as much coverage by the case as possible.Definately buy this case, but get it at Office Depot where its only $19.99.",78
0,Strange Effects,"When I placed this device on my TV I think it worked too well, suddenly I was unable to receive any digital TV stations, only analogue broadcast through the air. As soon as I removed the sticker my TV worked properly again. I had a similar effect with my cell phone, I was unable to receive calls until I removed the sticker.These things work TOO well",66

0,Terrible!,"I have lived in France - in Paris. I have been fortunate enough to have traveled throughout Normandy and Brittany and most recently, Provence. I can attest to the fact that this book is not reflective of authentic Provencal decoration.Provence decor is much more earthy, much more eclectic. It encomapasses the new couch with the comfortable chairs that have seen several generations. The people of Provence treasure their time-worn furniture and artifacts. The photos in this book show contrived, over-decorated settings which are completely out of step with the lifestyle of Provence where families, including children and pets really LIVE in their homes. Even affluent families with homes decorated by professionals, do not have rooms like these.",117
1,Intriguing Brahms intermezzos.,"I'm mostly familiar with the Intermezzos played here. Gould released them seperately on vinyl for Columbia in the 1960'a. That recording, as included on this two CD set, is very special.Particularly, Opus 118 #2. Gould kind of draws out the inner voices of these intimate Brahms piano pieces like no other pianist I have heard. He makes you relealize that each note is important and that it could not possibly be left out. I surely would recommend this CD set, if for no other reason than that.",87
0,Total and utter nonsense.,"I can't believe that Tom DeLonge and Travis Barker even had the gall to put this junk out. It's just the next Blink 182 album, minus the singer who's voice is actually tolerable (Mark) and plus more awful, awful lyrics from Tom. Not to mention that the music isn't much of a departure from Blink's usual poppy, 3-chord fare. It's only amusing to think that Box Car Racer are referred to as Tom and Travis' ""emo"" band and they compared themselves to Fugazi and Quicksand. If you want to buy something that is good, maybe actually get a Fugazi album or something. Dare to explore. These 30-something teenagers sure didn't.",110

1,"Effective, doesn't make water taste too bad","I've used these several times over the past year, and compared to other chemical water treatments they're relatively painless. You don't have to force yourself to down chemical-tasting water.To the earlier reviewer who mentioned treatment time: 4 hours is a worst-case scenario mandated by the EPA for killing one type of organism (cryptosporidium) in water that is both very cold and very dirty. All bacteria and viruses, except cryptosporidium and giardia, are killed in 15 minutes (even in cold water). Cryptosporidium and giardia are both killed in 30. In cold, very dirty (cloudy) water, it can take 4 hours for a full crypto kill.",104
0,Falls off,"I purchased this cap to replace the one we lost from our 18-55 mm Canon lens. This is the kit lens that comes with the Rebel T1i and it is labeled 58 mm. Like other reviewers have noted, the cap falls off with the slightest tap. It seems that the 2 side tabs that apply the pressure to the lens rim do not quite expand far enough out to fully grip. This was surprising since I thought buying a Canon branded cap would assure me a tight fit.I ended up removing and modifying the inner tension ring of the cap so the tabs would expand further out. Just use a small metal file to remove some of the plastic that hold it in place and reinstall.",126
0,I USED to be blonde...,"Wow, I feel like such an idiot...I had already shampooed and applied the product when I decided to look up reviews. I am a blonde and started to freak out when I saw that others were reporting brassy and orange discoloration after using the product. I decided that my hair still looked bright & blonde, so it was probably some fluke on their part. I was even happier when, after blow-drying my hair, it STILL looked shiny, straight and still immaculately blonde. Fantastic! Until I started in with the straightening iron. I was almost in tears as I saw my hair change from gorgeous to brassy & tacky. This product may work, but it's certianly not for anyone with light hair. I am extremely disappointed that it states it's ""safe for all types of hair, even color-treated & highlighted"", when it's obviously not. Now I have to deal with hoping that I can return the crap to get my $16 bucks back so that I can turn around and pay someone to fix my hair color. Terrible product.",178
1,Gospel Truth,"One of the happy outcomes of The Da Vinci Code phenomenon is a wider awareness of the ""Gnostic Gospels"". Publishers have not been slow to respond, but this precious volume towers above the crowded scene along with its companion titles in the series: the Gospels of Thomas and Philip. The French admire and understand these long-lost Scriptures and Leloup uniquely combines mystical insight with scholarly wisdom. The big problem is that other most editors and commentators ""leave the track"" because they are one or the other. Your best guide is qualified in both fields! Take this book to your heart.",100
1,"Fascinating, hilarious, and witty!","""Courtesans and Fishcakes"" is without a doubt thecleverest and most entertaining bit of writing on classical Athens Ihave ever come across. Davidson combs the classical authors (many of whom had seemed drained of life by other scholars) and finds remarkable and startling things about the ancients' love of wine, sex, and, not least, fish.

It will not charge a battery that is ""dead"" without faulting. Best to give your battery a boost from a manual charger, then switch over to the Smart charger. The battery clamps are very poorly made and will easily break. Replacement parts are not available through the manufacturer.",70
0,This is two hours of my life I can't get back.,"Although there were a few humorous parts in this movie, there was no plot. I kept trying to find it, but it wasn't there.

0,God Awful,"this musical is the pits. I saw it on Broadway and loved it because the sets were as integral as the production. But the major mistake the film makers made was to film this on location, using the actual streets of Manhattan (where I live)It was a gimmick that you couldn't forget in watching this hideous exercise in movie making. In watching the cast prancing up empty New York streets, and wondering how did they do that, you get easily bored because there's so little color. The cast is wretched. No wonder you've never heard of any of them since except for Victor Garber. ""Day by Day"" sounds like a bunch of bleating sheep, because the singers are so desperate to make the story come alive. I'm usually a sucker for any musical but this is one that will never find its way onto my shelf.",146
1,Too perfect!,"This book had me laughing from beginning to end because majority of the things she talks about are so dead on! Coming from a ""shiksa's"" point of view, Grish nailed it.

Even if you aren't dating a jewish man yourself, the book is full of witty lines and makes for a great beach read.",88
0,This would be fun and educational but Galt messed up,"My children used an older version of this type of marble game and went bonkers over it. The toy we used was a friends. My wife bought Galt's version and I am ready to toss it into the garbage can. I just hope the retailer will accept a return. The problem is that Galt's materials engineers cut back on the connector strength and the pieces do not stick together well. All it takes to knock this toy down is a minor bump. My kids were totally frustrated and so was I. This was not an issue with the toy my friend had.Galt, you saved a few pennies on plastic on each set you built but you created a useless toy. Two thumbs down!!!!!!",123
0,"Um, Interesting, I Guess","Well, this book is different, I guess. My 6th grade teacher made me read it, along with many other books. I don't think that that the character deserves to be glorified. He had no respect for his family, his life, and the wilderness. He actually believed that he and a bag of rice could brave the Alaskan wilderness. As always, the wilderness overcame. He got what he deserved. The best part was the little paragraph on the back cover about the author, because I couldn't wait to get there. The book was very slow. There was a lot of gobbely-gook, and the writing was nothing special. I would recomend this to someone who has read every other book on earth.",120

When I could get the software to work the employees could not understand the Spanish translations. It also was not compatable with the reservation software that I use and blew it off my computer. I had to reload the reservation software after loading the language translator. Then when I shut the computer down at night it blew my reservation software off again. The technical support was absolutely useless. The only thing they would offer was a program for over $200 that they said would work better. When I tried to get my money back I was told to forget it. Don't buy this unless you have money to throw into the trash.,130

Don't know where to send it to be repaired and no doubt they would charge me more than I want to pay. This recorder feels fragile and is not well made.

I simply used the automatic function of the Apricorn software to clone the new hard drive from the drive in the computer. I replaced the old drive with the new one and the computer booted up and ran normally. The old drive went into the housing for reformat and use as an external backup drive. Since the Apricorn package had the software and I had all needed hardware, I got the new hard drive in an OEM package for even more savings. Delivery from Amazon was prompt and there was very little effort involved in the job.",115
0,Tips over in deeper snow - Crying bundles of joy,"We live in an area where we can get over 8 inches of snow. When it gets that deep, this product tends to tip over.We've used this for when our kids were like 1 year+ and we had to go around the yard and pack down the snow in a path or else it would tip over, putting our little bundles of joy face down in the snow!If you're only going on a packed snow paths, it's perfectly fine, but we go on the sidewalk then into the fresh snowfall in the backyard, and it never fails to tip over crying, freezing toddlers.Really surprised it's not mentioned in other reviews.",110

1,Dion Rocks,"One of my most favourite CDs.Dion has a beautiful singing voice as a solo artist.Most people seem to be most familiar with his material from his days with The Belmonts,but I love both albums on this CD.Each album has a different sound to it.Dion sounds a little spaced out on Born To Be With You.Streetheart has a bluesy peaceful jazz sound to it.Back when I was ten years old,I remember having a""20 original hits,20 original stars""type of album called Blazzing Bullets on eight-track tape,during the days when eight-track tapes were the norm.Dion's Make The Woman Love Me was included on the tape.Buying this CD from the internet in much more recent time,marks my first time ever hearing this song since I was ten.In And Out Of The Shadows is a perfect slow dancing song.I love this song so much,that I sometimes find myself singing along to it.The saxophone is beautifully played in the song Streetheart.",155
1,fantastic!,I just love this cookbook! It's recipes are easy to follow and the end results are always as good as they look in the accompanying photographs! In my opinion (for what it's worth)'Sydney Food' is better than anything that Jamie Oliver or Nigella Lawson has to offer!,47
1,Good electric toothbrush,It took me a long time to pick an electric toothbrush. All the reviews on amazon.com were very helpful. I bought this version and I have no regrets. This electric toobrush works really well and comes with 4 brush heads. My teeth feel nice and clean; the same feeling I have when I leave the dentist after a cleaning. Make sure you read the directions so you know all the features that this toothbrush has.,75
1,Great Show,"I purchased this on a whim when it went on sale, and it did not disappoint. This is probably the funniest show I have ever seen. There are so many undertones and jokes that it takes a second viewing to fully understand. The only problem is that the show got dropped and there were only 3 seasons!In terms of quality, it is standard for a TV series. The first season is a slightly lesser video quality than the next 2, as is with all TV series (because they don't know if the show will get picked up or continued).You should have bought this yesterday. Seriously.",105
1,Nunca he perdido la Fe!,"Con esta frase quiero transmitir uno de los descubrimientos más espectaculares del Sendero Espiritual al que uno puede llegar una vez que lee las palabras del Arcángel Miguel y de la Señora Fe. En una página notable Ellos develan la Verdad de que eso de ""perder la Fe"" es imposible ya que siempre ""la andamos trayendo"" en la Llama de Dios que está en el corazón. ¿Qué es lo que sucede a menudo? Que uno coloca esa Fe en personas, sitios, condiciones y hasta cosas que no son constructivas por lo que se experimenta angustia, tristeza, desilusión... que no son más que enfocar equivocadamente ese tremendo poder de la Fe. Gracias a Dios he aprendido lo efectiva que es la Fe cuando la coloco en lo que es bueno y elevador!",131

I loved it, the first two times I used it. I followed the instructions to the T, and warmed it at 30 second intervals.Then it caught fire in my microwave.I'm serious - as it turns out, it has a metal zipper pull. I heard a pop from the kitchen and opened the microwave to discover the zipper pull had fired off and the material around the zipper was charring.So, yeah, cloves and lavender smell great. Burning synthetic material = not so much.I wouldn't recommend to anyone who's looking to lesson the stress in your life.",121
1,Ramage the Spy,"In which Lt. Ramage speaks with Lord Nelson and smugglers alike, takes passage for ""Boney's"" France, is astounded and becomes a shipwright, employs a thief, speaks to a policman of knives and sealing wax, and joins the French army! One suspects that Liberty - Equality - Fraternity meant only the liberty to reduce your brother citizens into equal misery. Of course, the British Navy's blockade also had something to do with the desperate state of the French economy revealed here (and rarely depicted in other seafaring series).If you like stories of the Napoleonic era you'll enjoy this close up view of the French Terror into which idealists descended, but if your desire is only battle at sea this volume will disappoint. As far as I know this is the only nautical novel that brings its naval hero so far and long into enemy France (perhaps Pope is fulfilling the promise of C.S. Forester's ""Hornblower During The Crisis"" left unfinished by Forester's death before HH gets ashore).",166

1,This course is incredible!!,"This course is an absolute knockout. It's very well organized and modular. The amount of learning that is involved with learning how to be a DBA can be a bit daunting. This video-coarse presents a lot of material in a very skilled manner. The video lectures are very well thought out and the book is very straightforward and informative. These instructors have taught at Columbia University's CTA Program and their depth of knowledge and experience is evident in these lessons. Possibly the best thing about this course is the fact that the authors created it with the student in mind. In the end, the emphasis is on the education of the STUDENT, not just the education of the instructor. I hope they continue with the video-course concept, it works really well!!",131
1,Gary Kicks 'butt'!,"This 1992 release by Gary Richrath really kicks 'butt'. Gary's new band with Michael Janz sounds very similar to old REO and Kevin.This album has a 1980 REO sound, very similar to ""Nine Lives"" or ""Tuna Fish"" albums. All songs very strong to fairly stong. Gary's guitar never sounded better and Michael Janz's voice is great. If you ever wondered how REO would sound today with Gary in charge, this will show you. When I listen to all the REO albums since Gary left, I think of how much better they would sound with Gary. REO has no edge now. We can only hope that one day we'll get to hear that again!",113

My boys bought it for me so I hardly felt I could take it back even though that was my first thought on seeing the RCA label. Surely this model would be better? NO! This one has done the same thing though it gave me no warning. After turning on the power it does nothing except say WELCOME. Of course it was one month out of warranty. Now there are 5 DVD's stuck inside, two of which are rentals and no one from customer service will respond. RCA obviously stands for Real Cr** America.",147

You feel as though you know the characters as you readthrough each of the series of these books. The events in these books are real life and make you take stock of what you have. You come to have a much greater respect for the jobs that these people do and feel fortunate that they are there if you need them. Mr. Telep has a way of pulling you into each book. You feel like you are along for the ride. We have had a hard time putting these books down to take care of regular business. We have read each and everyone of the Night Angel series and hope that he will come out with additonal books for this series soon.Thank You,135
1,Let Down,"Harryq is correct. The album sounds great and all, but the overall release could've been made sweeter. like he said, the album isn't even gatefold. there isn't any special tracks or anything else like that either. also, in the insert with all of the lyrics has quite a few typos. on top of all that, disc 1's hole was too small to fit on my record player and i had to make the hole bigger to play it. the LP release was disappointing.",83

0,Problems with these dvds,"This mini-series, on 2 dvds has an excellent cast. It appears to also have a good and believable story line. However, there is no close captioning. That would normally be alright for those of use with hearing problems because we can wear headphones and turn up the volume. In this case that doesn't work. The music, war sounds and ambient sounds in the film are so loud that they drown out 85 - 90% of the speaking. I was unable to hear little more than 4 to 5 scenes. I had to guess what was happening. I am extremely frustrated and angry. I wasted both my time and money on this mini-series. I am a disabled senior citizen and reading books (from Amazon) and movies are about all I am able to do. I have very little money and so to have spent it on this was very disconcerting.",149

I can only hope since I am a regular customer that Amazon will honor my claim and reimburse me the $18.85. Will update everyone later after this is resolved.

1,Nashville is Worth the Hype,"After watching the first three episodes of Nashville, I can definitely say that Nashville is worth the hype it received in promotion. Excellent writing, acting, music and storylines. Nashville has it all.The characters are well developed with what first appear to be stereotypical stock characters flowering into aching, yearning human beings. Deacon in particular doesn't do what the viewer expects. The setting is original and well captured as well and a refreshing change of pace from the usual doctor, lawyer and police procedurals. The music runs the gamut in country styles from classic to pop and is a real addition to the show and I say this as a person who isn't necessarily a fan of country music...but I love this. A home run for ABC.",126
0,Let's not confuse things.,"Actually, I find the argument that these books should be judged simply on their own terms to be absurb, especially since the fabrication of JT Leroy was used to lure readers to the books in the first place. In other words, the books are fiction but the marketing device to get us to read them was a lie, pure and simple. So that's how these writings by Laura Albert should be understood--not as a stand-alone works of fiction but as a marketing tool to fool the public into buying them. If the hoax of JT Leroy shouldn't matter in regard to the books than why, I wonder, was it used in the first place?",114
1,The Gingery Charcoal-Fired Furnace,"This is a great book, and the best that I have found so far on getting started in foundrywork.It covers all of the essentials, and guides you step-by-step through the process of building your charcoal-fired furnace. No prior experience in any form of metalworking or handicrafts is required, although some carpentry experience is rather useful. I am a full-time welding and machining student, and this(and Dave's other books in this series), are literally a dream come true.If you enjoy tinkering with stuff, and dream about being a machinist/foundryman/all-around do-it-yourselfer, then you owe it to yourself to get this book, and the others in the series.Have fun!",106

I have not been able to figure it out, but after reading other reviews I think maybe the problem was that the coffee grounds may have splattered into the water reserve, and I can never get the taste of old stale coffee grounds out of my new coffee.

After getting all the fuel out of the old filter, I could tell it was noticeably heavier than the new one... that extra weight was the sludge trapped in the filter!Changing the filter was super easy, minus getting the hoses removed from the old one. Once they slipped onto the new one, they were snug enough to leave on without clamps, but I tightened the clamps on anyways.The other 'challlenge' was locating the fuel pump's relay, which I could never find despite all the documents and 'maps' I used... It was much more simpler to find the power plug for the fuel pump and umplug it.... all for the purpose of relieving pressure in the line before the replacement.",149
0,Nothing quite as frustrating as an extended intellectual misfire,"I appreciate brevity. Seems to me most commentary and analysis goes on too long. That was my attraction to this title, but that's not the problem here. Every topic is handled concisely though often not very effectively. The problem here is a twisted central view that produces sheer nuttiness like this books anachronistic take on Freud. I wish I had more time to elaborate, but, suffice it to say, you WILL be disappointed. This book is about a dozen re-writes from something worthwhile, and I wish I'd looked the reference section over a little more rigorously before wasting my money on this tome.",103

My order was received quickly, and the lens is everything it says it is...I would like to see it focus a little faster...it seems to need more light than my other lenses to hit the focus point clearly, but other than that, this is a very nice product. My shots are clearer, and cleaner than with my other lenses, and the 62 mm size brings in a lot more light. A great general purpose lens. Shipping was extremely prompt, and Tamron was more than timely with the rebate. An outstanding buy. Highly recommended.",121

1,Voyage of Steve Hackett,"Voyage of the Acolyte is actually the first Genesis solo album (one minor error in Paul Clark's nice review). This solo album came out before Peter Gabriel's first solo album. It was recorded in June & July of 1975 just after the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway Tour. Peter Gabriel had just left the band, and Genesis had yet to record Trick of the Tail (November, December 1976). Steve Hackett's first solo voyage shows the depth of creativity which he only continued to expand throughout his post-Genesis solo career which began after his departure following the Wind & Wuthering tour. Steve continues to this day to do things most rock musicians wouldn't, or couldn't, do (like record a CD with the Royal Phil, or play the Vivaldi guitar concerto with the English Chamber Orch). The cover is one of many of the beautiful pieces of art work done by Steve's wife, Brazilian artist Kim Poor (greatly praised by Salvador Dali).",160

1,Amazing Job,"This book takes a look at an aspect of politics we usually don't think about---- how the actions of politicians teach children lessons contrary to those taught by most parents. The book presents a well-researched look at various scandals during the Clinton Administration, governmental and media reaction to them, and, most importantly, the subtle messages they sent to children about accountability and truth.What is truly amazing is that this book was written by a 17 year old high school student. The perspective is one we don't often see. Although my own political posture does not mirror the author's, I must agree with his overall premise. He has made some very thoughtful observations about American values.The book is easy to read, and I highly recommend it.",125

1,Life on the road to California with 4000 Texas Long Horns with a little romance thrown-in along with tragedy,"The author did such a fantastic job describing the mountains, terrains, and the rivers, I felt as though I was there. There was also some comedy not only with the love-birds, but others which kept me laughing between tragidies as they ocurred. I have read about 25 books and they keep getting better. There is one co-author whom I did not care for. One of the books was ""By The Horns"". I don't remember The title of the other book. All in all, I think the books can't get any better, but I know that I will be on the edge of my chair as I read the next book.",110

I have a program that won't run and no help to get it going. A waste of money, so far, and I'm pretty angry!",108
0,Awful stats textbook,"I hated this book, and I only bought it because it was required for my homework assignments. If you choose not to go to class or need the text for extra help with concepts and equations, well, you're in trouble. There are a lot of Greek symbols and theoretical equations, but few practical examples that would help you learn to solve problems. I had the author for my professor, and his lectures were totally different from how things are presented in the text (and much more informative and useful). If you don't absolutely NEED the book for homework problems, I would recommend not buying it and simply attending lecture.",109

The buttons on the remote for vol+, vol-, and mute will only operate the TV volume, regardless of what mode you are in. So even though you programed an amp into the remote, the volume controls will only operate the TV volume. This would be nice if you don't have an amplifier, but most people who have need of a 7 device remote use an amp.It is possible to ""learn"" the amp volume controls onto other buttons, but that makes for confusion. Remotes are confusing enough already.The Philips 5 device remote has this same unfortunate feature (I bought that model first!!)I returned my Philips remote and bought a One For All remote that lets me choose which device I can assign the volume controls to.",144

Alas, I fell asleep over Red Mars, but I finished that one, just because I hoped it would get better.

Really, it was totally uninspired and to boring to endure!",91

We bought a really cheap adapter for two euros and she was able to use her blow dryer with out a problem for the rest of the trip. Since we took the instructions with us, and followed everything it said, I'm hoping we can return the product. We also double checked to make sure that the voltage on the dryer was set correctly.I wouldn't waste my time or money on this product.",132

This disc is ALL I am going to need to supplement my practice at home. I just hit pause and turn on some tribal fusion music and practice each move after the BEAUTIFUL and articulate Leila of Egypt introduces them. She spends time repeating them herself, on the DVD, but I need like 5 minutes of solid practice, PER MOVE. So having a DVD to start and stop is perfect.",143

Really; the price is high and the shipping is also high for this tiny tube of various seed oils. I recommend Aveeno lip conditioner in chapstick form with an SPF of 15, much better.

1,Its good,This game is a pretty good game. Now here I screwed up because I played MGS2 first but then I got this game. Now I must say it is a very good game but now a days it would have horrible graphics but I truly don't care about graphics. You really should buy this game before you buy MGS2 or else you won't understand 80% of MGS2. Also this game is really hard if you you play on Extreme mode so it does get frustrating sometimes. Really the only reason I give this game 4 stars is because of the graphics but if I could I would give it 4 and 3/4 stars. If you dont care about the storyline then you should just buy MGS2 because its graphics are like 100 times better.,134
0,stopped working after 1 year 3 months,I had a bad feeling when this unit arrived. Worked ok for a while then after about 9 months various buttons started malfunctioning. Very cheap parts. the most cheap feeling stereo I have ever purchased. I wish I went with my gut and returned this piece of garbage in the beginning. I have since bought a pioneer deh 4300 and it works great. If you have an ipod the pioneer 4300 works great with it. I have an ipod touch. I wish I went with the pioneer in the beginning instead this unit. I wanted hd radio. It works alright but I live in orange county just south of L.A. It cuts out enough to be annoying. Factor that in with the extremely cheap radio its housed in and one year later its done. Not surprising it broke so fast when you see how cheap this thing is made. As far as hd radio goes when its not cutting out it sounds great. I think I will wait until they get hd radio working better before I go this route again. Dual should be ashamed of making radios this bad.,190

0,A worthwhile topic but lacking focus and proportion.,"Brokaw's thesis is that a generation tested by (a) the Depression, and (b) WWII, rose to the challenge and deserves our respect and admiration. This may be true, but Brokaw does not prove it. His book lacks the kind of rich specificity which would be convincing. For the various people he interviews, he gives us very little on how they survived the Depression. And as the book advances, we get less and less of the particulars of how the subjects experienced the war. The problem may be that there are too many subjects, or interviewees, to be handled with the thoroughness or depth that is finally convincing. At the end, we are left only with the warm feeling that they have survived, and we can all be grateful for that, but not with a sense that we have come finally to know them, especially in their past, and how that past has shaped them, which is, after all, the point of the book.",163

Finally the book opens with the first of ""The Best New Horror"", a triffling werewolf story that left me wanting. Better stories are told by 6-year olds.

The least the company could do is make good substitutes for their polycarbonate bottles - since it seems to me they quietly market the fact that these bottles can replace polycarbonate bottles as a ""safe"" alternative.",102

0,UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS!,"If it was at all possible I would give this contraption a rating of ""0"" stars. It worked well the first day, and then as stated in the other reviews promplty went of the fritz. Being an engineer I took it apart to find out if I could see what was wrong. The plastic casing was indeed not waterproof! There was no rubber lining to prevent water from entering and so it promptly shorted out. Not only that, the thing refused to turn off and picked up all sorts of random radio transmission. This piece of junk should be considered illegal for how poorly it works, correction, formerly worked.",109
1,Good natural history for kids,This was one of the books my son loved as a boy. Not necessarily outstanding literature. But it was amazing to see the journey taken by such a fragile creature as a butterfly all the way from the US northeast to Mexico. It was a fun and painless way to introduce a small child to some of the wonders of the natural world.,63

1,A dvd write drive that works close to 100% of the time,"I say close to 100% because I have had 2 failures doing writes to the drive. Yes, it could have been the software that froze, but it might have been the firmware too. Unlike the exact same drives reviewed by a few others, it has recognized every single blank DVD I have tried. I wish I could say that for the built-in NEC DVD+R that came with my Dell. It was always very picky and finally I gave up on it. Then I bought a second internal model made by IO Magic. It reads everything quite well but doesn't write DVD-anythings nor even CD-Rs. So it was onto an external Sony drive that works ok until the firmware somehow loses connection with the computer, and then the drive no longer appears (and the disc is ruined).Additionally, the Plextor's the only one that consistently works with DVDXCOPY or DVDNEXTCOPY.",148

1,A Logophile's Lark,"First off, this is a review of the Second Edition, published in 2004, which, for whatever reason, Amazon doesn't have listed. This ""encyclopedia"" is a sort of Yank version of Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, so popular in England. It's fun to read or skim through the anecdotal etymologies provided, even if, at the end of the entry, Hendrickson admits that they're probably apocryphal. The only two criticisms I have of this 2004 edition are that there are far too many ephemeral entries from the last few years that probably won't outlive the decade and, secondly, Hendrickson is a wee bit too obviously a baseball fanatic and there is far too large a proportion of baseball-derived entries than is merited - Aside from these two small criticisms, an irresistible compilation of words, phrases and the stories (true or not) behind them.",142

This book wasn't scarey, but very interesting and I can't wait to read more in this series. My friends at school all wanted to borrow my book! I highly recommend this book.",54
1,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,Great book. I hadn't read it since the 60's!So much better than the movie. It was our book club's September reading. A wide range of women from 40-75. It was all agreed upon that this book was worth reading again.,40
0,this cd sucks,"i dont care how this cd was made. its still the worst beast boy cd to date. im sure the next one will be even worse. the videos are also getting worse. im embaressed that these washed up white boys got the mtv best rap video award over buster rymes. the beasties stole part of busters style and songs and did a hack job of it. just like they stole other rappers styles. if they want to go off into rehab programs and find god, thats ok. but why would they make such a bad cd?",96
1,Fascinating look at the weak link in war....MAN!!!,This is a fascinating and somewhat morbid humorous look at man's ability to kill himself in war......even if this means killing himself and his allies. The book reads well as a result of the author's interesting and humorous manner of writing. Sure it is not a humorous subject but sometimes one cannot help but laugh at the abject stupidity of mankind throughout history. This book proves that no matter how much technology advances there is always a weak link...mankind. Furthermore this book also proves that there shouldn't be such a fuss about blue on blue kills in the first or second Gulf Wars since this is nothing compared to the blue on blue in past conflicts.,116

1,finally some great prog,"Spock's Beard's first CD, ""The Light"" is one of the best examples of progresive rock I have ever heard, and anybody who doesn't think so needs to stop taking the music so seriously. If the lyrics are not a new revelation in your life, then fine, listen to some great instrumentation played by people who know what they are doing (for a change). Yes and Genesis are all well and good, but the lyrics they wrote are no more spectacular than these lyrics. Real prog fans who don't like this CD need to lighten up and stop looking for the 2nd messiah in their music.",105

1,Brings Back the Christmas Memories - Just not for my Son,"I LOVED this album as a child, and I still love it to this day. It's well worth having as an addition to your Christmas music collection. For me, the Chipmunks carry the fun through the entire album. Please note, on this album you are dealing with the classic Chipmunk and David Seville sound rather than the modern variation (which I find a bit annoying). It's fun and entertaining, and I listen to it at least once each Christmas season. However, this year when I put the album on, my son commented that, while he liked ""The Chipmunk Song"", 16 Chipmunk songs in a row might be a bit much. It's a generational thing I guess. Highly recommended!",118
1,Sleeper review I,"A very thought provoking series. Gives different avenues as to how a terrorist cell could thrive in the US and go undetected.

0,This Recording Is A Total Dud,"This recording is a total dud and is to be avoided at all costs. I think this is the worst performance of Scheherazade I have ever heard. It is the worst conducted and the worst played, even worse than the many quick, budget-label runthroughs going back to the 1950's with unknown orchestras and unknown conductors. Each of the standard Scheherazade recommendations vastly exceeds this lame performance. For a good unknown recording, try the Dorati/Minneapolis Mercury recording. Just about any performance from the past is superior to this. If modern sound is a major criterion, get the Chung on DG.",99
0,Horrific,"This is by far, the most ridiculous attempt at a book I have ever encountered. It staggers the mind to consider that the author made any effort to write it, and on top of that, that it was actually published.The book is composed like a 5th grade book report; shallow to the point that you wonder if the author spent as much time writing it as you did reading it, immature in both content and style, and generally pointless. The concept of sexual addiction is far more profound than either Zane's unlikeable character, Zoe, or her exploration of it which never manages to rise above the sea of vulgarity and graphic descriptions of the act itself.This is the sort of book for people who believe that anyone who can read can write.",132
1,A Great Adventure for the Little Ones!,"Our four-year-old daughter loves Dora the Explorer, so we were delighted to see the release of Lost City Adventure. The reviews so far have been raves from the little one (and from us). The animation, music and sound are first rate, but more importantly, the challenges are appropriately measured for a pre-schooler. This program stacks up well against the Knowledge Adventure titles like Reader Rabbit. Skills such as sequencing, color matching, memory and basic addition are developed in fun and entertaining environments. Plus, there are three difficulty levels, so if your child is frustrated or bored at a certain level, you can adjust accordingly.The program works great using the Classic environment on our Macintosh G4 laptop and G3 desktop computers. Have fun!",122
1,You cannot be an Acca Dacca fan and not own this album,"Back In Black is timeless rock purity. That the year is 2011 is irrelevant. I am confident that if I am still alive in 2021, this album will remain on my playlist.",32
0,"No, I liked it","I liked the book because it was more normal than Doreen Virtue's stuff. I read her book on angels but it was pretty way out. Like when she talks about people with spaceships attached to them and people who are cats in human bodies and calls them all kinds of angels. I don't think they are angels.I wanted somthing that would talk about angels and this book was good because it did and was clear and easy to understand. I learned to write to my angel from this one and it is very helpful to do so.If you think of angels in a normal way, you will like this book. If you want to read about angels from outer space, you will not.I think the first reviewer was pushing that other lady's book, myself.Gala",134
0,The H in Harle stands for HORRIBLE,"Poor sound quality, lousy musical interpretation, and other problems make this album a horrible set of saxophone concertos. Harle almost never uses vibrato, plays outlandish cadenzas, and even skips entire phrases he doesn't want to play on some occasions. The expressiveness in his playing is almost non-existant, not to mention some technical problems, too. For example, at the end of the Glazounov concerto, instead of playing low C - middle C - altissimo C quarter notes, Harle starts on a low C and plays a *very* sloppy, uneven scale ascension to the altissimo C. His playing is generally pisspoor and his overall performance subpar. Try listening to interpretations by Eugene Rousseau, Dale Underwood, Donald Sinta, or other saxophonists. Just stay away from John Harle. FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IN THIS WORLD, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING BY JOHN HARLE!",142

1,Raised in the Country?,"This story starts with the Civil War, a lot of blood and guts, and pain. If you can get through the first few pages it is an excellent book. It takes place in the Blue Ridge and Smokey Mountains. I soaked up the description of the land like a sponge, fog, mist, hills, valleys, green foliage, and squeaky snow. Ada the woman and Inman the man have a hard time coming together, the work is hard, surviving with no food or shelter. From Ruby- who knows how to live off the land, to Teague- the leader of the guard looking for deserters, to Pancy- the addled banjo picker, to the goat woman, the people in the story are great.",119

1,A true trek story with a theatrical reading,"Well, for those who are into star trek this story is just perfect: vulcans, myths and action. For those who are not it still is due to a fantastic 'performance' by Gates McFadden. The story itself a fantastic one with some scifi violence included comes totally to life with its talented reader. It's worth listening to this audiobook wherever time allows to. And its always worth relistening.",67
0,Not what I expected,"I wasn't at all impressed with this book for a few reasons. Although the pictures were beautiful and tried most desperatly to pull us into the story, we just couldn't get to the same place that the author must have been while writing the book. Maybe after reading just the first sentence: ""Sometime after summer is spent but before jack-o'-lanterns are lit, it's apple picking time."", which seems to assume that everyone is interested in celebrating Halloween.In addition to this, the book speaks twice about ""the purple ticket"" that gets punched with a half moon. I still can't figure out what that is for. There are no explanations about the meaning of this and that is frustrating because it seems important but only the writer knows why. The sad part is that he kept this detail to himself and it's annoying.We tried to enjoy this book, but at this point its end will be in our Goodwill pile.",158
0,Sick,"It is very disturbing that someone would make a movie like this and somehow got the money to make it. But what I find more disturbing is that people would willingly pay money to see such a film, buy the DVD or rent it. And some of this people give this film a good rating. There is something seriously wrong with the human race. If you willingly watched this film or just want to, then I don't want to know you. As for the guy who made this movie and the sequel (!) I hope karma catches up with him quickly. Sick beyond belief. There is no justification for a movie like this. No wonder so many horrible things go on in this world. Any decent human being would be repulsed by this and never even watch it.",138

0,The worst of Ofra Haza.,"Having bought Shaday and Kirya by miss Haza, i bought Desert Wind with the notion that it would be as fantastic as the aforementioned. Boy was i wrong. Gone are the heavy Yemenite/Israeli beats and flavor, as is Haza singing in Hebrew. Instead, I found her beautiful voice swallowed up by abhorrent 80's synth-pop cheese and benal lyrical content, with Hebrew only in the chorus at most. There is not a single song, with the exception of ""Slave Dream"" that I could bear to listen to all the way through, and most of the songs are laughably bad. So, fans of Haza's other works, do yourself a favor and save your [money] and buy Shaday or Kirya. Unless you want a good laugh, then by all means, purchase away!",129
1,The Fanatic,"I enjoyed the wit, and gentle poking fun of religions (of all types) that have a way of leading mortals astray. While recognizing that dogma may hinder spiritual development, Lawson demonstrates that the fullest measure of a religious life, or any life, is in the living of life. His subtle humor is ruthlessly charming.",54
1,At Last-A whole CD of Josh Groban!,"My family and I have been Josh Groban fans for several years, after seeing him live with Sarah Brightman in the La Luna tour. His voice brings goosebumps to the skin! Of course, seeing him in the 1st Allie McBeal was a treat - can't wait for the 2nd visit on Dec. 10. But we have been waiting with great anticipation for an entire CD of Josh. This new CD did not disappoint, and the goosebumps were there for some time! His range is wonderful, and the breadth of songs included showcases his talent and gives a hint of even more wonderful music to come. The orchestration is full and rich on the CD, with the only wish to have the music mixed a bit under, so we can hear the most of Josh's incredible, gifted voice. We can't wait to hear the next CD, and to hear more duets with some of the well-known stronger female vocalists, for whom Josh is every bit a wonderful match. Bravo Josh, and many more to come!",174

1,He went out on a high note.,"I enjoy these two discs for much of the same reasons that I prefer Billie Holiday's later music. Sure, both of their voices had lost what range they had once possessed. Yes, their voices cracked and were off key much of the time; victims of the addictions which eventually claimed both of their lives. But like Billie, Chet Baker's voice developed an emotional level which often bordered on the scary. Just listen to him on the two versions of ""My Funny Valentine"" presented here, and see if you don't find yourself wiping away a few tears. Mr. Baker's trumpet playing, however, never seemed to fall victim to his addictions. If anything, its beauty only continued to bloom. The concert presented here was recorded only 2 weeks before the artists death and features the wonderful NDR Big Band and Radio Orchestra Hanover. For the pure emotional impact of the music, I highly recommend these discs.",154

0,Not worth the money,"I read through this book in a few hours. I was thinking it was an ""okay"" book untill I got to the supplement section. I felt like it was a commercial.

I have a hard time considering the recommendations credible when they are advertizing a body-building product.

0,"good drawing, poor erotica","The plot is utterly stupid. The illustrations are gorgeous, and, taken individually, very erotic. But somehow the overall effect of all of them together is just ho-hum. Manara has no sense of erotic timing: the final erotic encounter between Parva and Shiva, which could and should have been stretched sensuously over a couple of dozen pages, consists of a two-page wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am.

It could of been a good movie. It had talented actors, beautiful back drops, scenery, it was well filmed and crafted... but that all means nothing when you add in all the negatives I mentioned. It's just garbage and worthless- even if there is this little glimmer of hope at the end. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen not what it is proposed as in the previews. Not satisfied.",125

0,Don't be fooled by the MTV.,"The video is great, the rythm is great. No doubt, ""Praise You"" is a wonderful song. It was wonderful enough to make me check out the album. However, I sold it the next day. After listening to all the songs, I discovered that the entire cd only contained four different words, one of them being the ""f word"" which, in the song ""In Heaven"" is repeated constantly for upwards of 60 times. Creativity? I see none. ""Praise You"" is a catchy song, but the album itsself is anything but catchy. Don't waste your money like I did. Instead, if you're into good pop music--check out Cher's new release or the new one by REM. If you want other better alternitives to this album that don't involve music, try beating your head on hot rocks. Better still--stab yourself in the chest repeatedly and go for a dip in your psycho neighbor's alcohol spa.",152

The show follows in steps of many others dealing with the same issue and the only reason for people to watch is that everyone wants to be there themselves.",82
1,Movie Review,A good movie starring Derek Luke and Forest Whitaker. Ernie Davis was a great college halfback in the Syracuse tradition after the great Jim Brown.

1,Great set.,"Got this set at a very good price on Amazon. These are wonderful, sharp, heavy knives. I used the carving knife the other day to cut some marbling out of a roast, and it was SO EASY. I normally cannot stand working with raw meat. Also, had no problems thinly slicing a flank steak, and, of course, the steak knives cut through a filet like butter! Also, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the case.",77
0,"Good concept, poor execution","This was a good theory to revolve a movie around (I won't spoil it here), and after the first 15 minutes and learning the plot I had high hopes. Regrettably the movie fell victim to poor dialogue, wooden performances, and odd camera work.",43
1,Amazing for milk ad collectors,"The Milk Mustache Book offers fun facts, behind-the-scenes photos, and we can't forget the 100+ ads themselves!

1,Much better than the older versions!,"I had the version of this game before it and like it...but felt like it was lacking.And this version fixed that! It now has a board instead of a notepad, pieces, and it is easier to see the final goal and see how you are doing.It is a really fun game to play with friends and family. Even if they aren't music buffs they will enjoy it!My favorite thing is that you can repeat cards in different games unlike so many games that are over once you have done all the cards. It works multiple times because you never know what songs you will think of!Overall it is a great game!",111
1,beautiful purse,i bought a knockoff style of this purse in june and by august it was tattered. so i bought the real thing. this purse is my favorite ever. it is so roomy holds everything i need. the interior doesnt tear and it looks wonderful. its so comfy to hold and is all around the best handbag you could wear.,59
1,You Fool,"ok, here i go on my first review. it may not really have anything to do with the album, but i am angry, disappinted and upset to see that one reviewer has misspelt the name odf track one.

1,The Pick of Destiny,"After all the hype, and after loving the first album, I thought I'd give the film a go. It isn't too bad, I was expecting more belly laughs than I got, but it is a genuinely amusing film that will kill a few hours on a Sunday afternoon. A few moments do make you chuckle out loud and there are some great cameos. Jack Black is his usual gurning, swearing, hilarious self and KG comes out with some great lines as well. Don't expect too much, but do expect a great film that doesn't take itself too seriously and that will raise a smile.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.",118

0,Not so smelly scratch and sniff,"I purchased this book for my daughter for Christmas. When it first arrived we enjoyed the story along with the scratch and sniff stickers that did initially release a scent. Within 4 weeks of first opening this book, most of the stickers had lost their scents. I must add that it had only been read about 5 times during this month. I noticed from the reviews that this has been a problem for many purchasers. The story is cute, but without the scratch and sniff portion, you may as well get a different Christmas book. I wrote a letter to the publisher to complain and never got a response. I would not recommend buying this edition.",116
0,Peppermint Creek Inn,"I thought the description sounded like a good read. In all fairness, the beginning of the book gives a warning as to what the content might include, but of course, you don't get that until you get the book. I got this when it was free and before most of the reviews were written or I probably would have passed.That being said, I think the story would have been a decent mystery without all the extremely graphic sex. The first part of the book described what they wanted to do to each other and the second part they did it. So much that quite a few times I felt like I was reading porn. I'm not a prude but I kept wondering if all the descriptions were really necessary to tell the story.I found myself skipping some of it just to get to who the bad guys were. The whole amnesia and bad cops story without the graphic sex would have made this a good book.",166

The Pogo Sticks (my personal favorites from the first video) make a welcome return, with some glow in the dark friends. The weakest entries were Resonant Chamber (a creepy and out-of-place guitar/wooden spider fusion), Cathedral Pictures (I don't like religious music or themes), and Gyro Drums. The rest are decent, particular Fiber Bundles. The intricate and perfectly timed light bundles glow with ethereal beauty.",109

1,If Jack Kerouac Were a Baseball Man...,"...ok, he was, but still. Kevin Kaduk ""drops out"" of the working world (a lackluster sports reporting gig in Kansas City) and moves to Lake View (aka ""Wrigleyville""), a Chicago neighborhood, with no ambitions other than attending Cubs games for a season. It's sort of like ""On the Road,"" in terms of its loose style. It's meandering. The sentences are short. So what. I dug it.The cover promises baseball, booze, and broads...and there's plenty of the first two (baseball and booze) but not enough broads. Kaduk watches the ladies. He stares at the ladies. And, once or twice, he talks to a lady. OK. But he doesn't provide enough vivid details: What are they wearing? What aren't they wearing? What color is their hair? What size are their racks? For a book written by a twentysomething male for twentysomething males, ""Wrigleyworld,"" like the 2005 Chicago Cubs, ultimately falls short of immortality.",151

Buzz Price was there crunching numbers for Walt when Disneyland was first developed and built, and then went on to work with the creaters of Sea World, Universal, Six Flags, Busch, and many other parks the world over. If you enjoy the history of the parks, or any of the intricacies of how a park is run or planned and built, you will enjoy this book. Most inspirational is the explanation of his overal philosphy to be a ""yes, if"" person and not a ""no, because"" person. I found it fascinating!",102

I took another two doses that day, but didn't have any more symptoms, so I decided to save them and see if I get the same results next time I feel bad.I'm not sure if I was getting a cold or had allergies, but the product did seem to help.

1,In the Mind of PTSD,"As always, Tim O'Brien's writing style is amazing, surprising. His structure is enjoyable to read, and re-read. I'll likely read this book again within the next few years just for the great description and prose.However, as much as I enjoyed the style, it took me a few chapters to get into the story. Had I not previously read a couple of O'Brien's other books, I might not have granted it as much time as I did. Luckily, I did give the book a chance because as soon as the story picked up, I was into it.O'Brien's veteran experiences provide a wonderful backbone for his characters and John Wade (the protagonists) is interesting and real. As an Iraq War veteran, I found a number of traits in the character that I could understand, and a couple I could relate too. At times I was surprised but the plot and I enjoyed where the winding trail led me.In the Lake of the Woods is a good book and I'd recommend it to anybody wanting to understand the inner working of a PTSD mind.",181

There are also beautiful, lush strings arranged and conducted by Claus Ogerman and played either by the London Symphony Orchesta or a L.A. session orchestra (a.k.a. the best musicians in town).The songs ! What a great and incredibly tasteful collection of classics...a delight to hear the Julie London hit ""Cry Me a River"" again...always adored ""Love Letters""...my favorite Burt Bacharach song, ""The Look of Love""...the delectable ""Besame Mucho"", and on and on...every track a pleasure to hear.Each song is taken at a slightly slower tempo than is perhaps usually heard...the better to dream by !

Shouldn't the software be included or at least suggestions of which to use? I downloaded Eudora Suite (free) and just can't figure this out.

This has repeated over the past year and a half where every 3 months or so, the fridge stops cooling on the fridge side. Well, today the freezer side stopped cooling. I am very upset since I lost a lot of food, and will lose a lot of time getting it repaired or replaced. Oh, also, the water filter bursted and spat out black stuff in the water for over a year. LG said there was nothing they could do. Never buying LG anything again. This fridge is the epitome of a cheaply made appliance.Don't buy this, unless you want to buy mine.

1,The Queen Serves Up Substance and Style,"Queen Latifah has had a stellar few years, and she caps it off with an exceptional album that will have the world looking at her in a whole new light. A departure from the rap and hip hop we are used to from this artist, ""The Dana Owens Album"" is a surprisingly fresh collection of old standards done in a jazzy style that Miss Owens pulls off with grace and power. The vocal interpretations on this album are simply dazzling. In an age of cookie cutter pop stars and redundant hip hop artists, it is a relief to see an artist go out on a limb and give us something of substance and style.",114

1,A good book if you're already a fan...,"Deveraux essentially wrote one book when she wrote ""Twin of Ice"" and ""Twin of Fire,"" but split it into two packages. It's the story of twins and their searches for love. You MUST read ""Twin of Ice"" first, as it sets up the story fully. The majority of ""Twin of Fire"" is to remind the reader of what happened in the first book, then giving the same events from the other twin's perspective. It's classic Deveraux, and a fan will like these (particularly ""Twin of Ice"", the better book). Be sure to read ""Twin of Ice"" first, and read ""Twin of Fire"" directly following. I didn't really like the ""playing catch up"" style of this book, but it was interesting to see the same events from many sides without muddying up the stories. If you're not already a fan, don't start with this one: read ""Sweet Liar"" or ""A Knight in Shining Armor,"" my personal favorites (and I've read all but two now). ""Twin of Fire"" was not her best, but it was a nice book to cuddle up with on the couch.",183

1,Don't Be Scared by the Bigwigs,"Some of the bad reviews for this book are scarey to read if you are a mom trying to help your child. They say it goes against scientific evidence and they use a lot of big words to make their case. My advice is to buy the book and try the Davis method for yourself. It worked for my 8 year old daughter and it is not cumbersome or complicated.

Wouldn't you trade all the ""scientific evidence"" in the world for just one book that might help your child to read?",178
1,Get it.,"I couldn't put this book down. Chock full of snippet quotes from the Punk/Rock/Glam world. Great for those of us w/ short attention spans. There's great stuff & some horrible stuff, too, but, like driving by an accident, you just gotta look.",42

0,"If you want to do well on the MCAT, DO NOT buy this book!","This book is a complete waste of time and money. The review section is way too general, and the four ""model"" examinations are both too easy and do not accurately reflect the actual content of the real exam. For example in the biological sciences sections, there were no organic chemistry questions at all, but instead an overwhelming majority of questions about human physiology. Anyone planning to take the MCAT would be better served by buying A) the released MCAT tests available from the AAMC and B) a better review book like Kaplan.",92
0,Title is misleading.,"I guess you can't expect too much for the price, but this isn't an in depth history of Gandhi. It actually provides very little information about the complexity of Gandhi's personality. This is more of a short essay written in praise of Gandhi and no analytical understanding of the man.",50
0,I found this book predictable and frought with errors.,"This book reads like a high-school journal. I have to say that after encountering the twelfth typographical error, I began searching for the publisher's address in a frustrated attempt to write back to them, informing them that their proofers were all on vacation when the print files were released. I wound up putting it on the shelf unfinished, and I plan to include it in my next yard sale. The plot was predictable and I found the characters to be shallow. I read a lot of fiction, but I was embarrassed to tell my friends about this one. I don't expect to read any more of this author's work, but I would advise her to find another publisher, one who can actually provide editing services.",125

But, I'm a professional instructor/consultant and have been at it for over 14 years and his materials keep on making me look real good to my clients and customers.Robbie, keep up the good work - to all of the rest of you, just buy the book and you'll realize how good it is. (I won't bother with the technical reasons....others have already enumerated the reasons this book is technically fully-baked.)Now, if you could just write on MOM 2005 and SMS 2003 like you do with Server 2003, Active Directory and Exchange...... :)Mark Myers",116

As a result, I don't understand how anyone can call this damn song ""beautiful"". I get sick to my stomach whenever I hear it.",88

0,NOT FOR BEGINNERS!!,"As a language instructor of English and French(MA in TESOL) I found this book to be problematic. There are not enough listening and vocabulary activities on the c.d. As a total novice in Polish I need a lot more chances to hear the pronunciation. Each chapter gives you a very brief dialogue and doesn't even review the pronunciations of the lists of new phrases and words from the book. Then, in the chapter review they include new words and phrases not yet introduced!! Hello? How can you review something not yet introduced? My fiancee is Polish and I will be going to live and work there next year. If anyone can recommend a decent polish workbook with grammar for beginners I would really love to hear about it!",128
0,Wait a second and take a breath!,"There should be a clear distinction between the real teachings of a certain religion and the actual behaviour of its followers. Muslims are also human and not one of them can claim that he is without a sin. It is no secret that Muslims can make mistakes in appliying and understanding their religion. The same is true in Christianity as was demonstrated by the Pope when he apologised for the evils commited by the Church throughout the ages. Thus to criticise Islam as being flawed and to base such criticisim on the behaviour of some of its adherents is to commit a grave mistake. In order to form an accurate picture of a certain religion, one should examine its teachings carefully and not base his conclusions on what is publicised in the media. I advise Warraq and some of the reviewers to wait a second, take a breath, and reexamine the issue in an enlightened fashion.",156

0,blew up in my face,"I purchased this unit a number of years ago on the basis of the oil filtration system and the ability to keep it clean in the dishwasher. I used it four or five times and was very pleased with the ability to drain the oil and keep the used oil in the fridge. About the fifth or sixth time I used it, it started making a loud bubbling noise, and when I opened the top, oil exploded all over the kitchen and my face. (fortunately I wear glasses and wasn't badly burned.) I think I called T-Fal and didn't get any satisfaction. I subsequently saw a recall notice for a JC Penney fryer that looked identical, but TFal continued to deny any knowledge of such a problem. At some point I tried using it again (on the porch), and it wouldn't go over 300 degrees, so maybe I just had a bad unit. I might try another one.",158
0,Guess work!,"I really wanted to enjoy this book. That being said, I found the authors traveling around the world and speculating on old fables to be quite annoying.

0,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"Horrible adaptation. I hadn't read the comic since I was a child, and went into this not remembering much, and I STILL hated it. Rights issues aside, why weren't there any other superheroes at Superman's funeral? Why did the producers think it would be a better selling point to dump all the original voice actors and get ""stars""? Why did they use cliche and throw in Lex Luthor as a villain? After I suffered this tripe, I read the first 3 issues of ""Death of Superman"" and I was even more sickened.ALL the pathos, depth and meaning from just the first issue was complete void in this animated garbage.MISSING was: Superman on a talk show defending his fighting for good to a hippy teenager while Doomsday was beating the Justice League to a pulp, Doomsday crushing a bird in his hand, blood dripping down as he laughs, etc etc)Shame SHAME on Bruce Timm and all others involved.",157

1,You leave me wanting.....,"I enjoyed ""Satisfy My Soul"" tremendously. However, the ending left me feeling a little like I had just fallen off a cliff. It seemed a bit abrupt, after the slow, methodical depictions of the characters and the intricate relationships developed throughout the book.

I also feel that once you get into it, you see a true beauty. I'm kinda of out with the jury here, but I will say that I liked the ending because Lester was at peace with himself and what happened. I liked it. Now, the wife, she lived in another zone completely. The daughter as well,(her and that boy were compatible), and her friend was just I'm so beautiful. Now, forgive me, but I am still unsure who did him in (My bet is the wife).All I can say is what a film!",116

0,unreadable,"Let me say first of all that I loved ""The Corrections"" which is why I was eager to read another offering from the same writer. But this book does nothing right. Every character is unlikable. The plot (or one of the many plot lines) involves the ""evil corporation"" cliche that dominates so many books and quickly became tiresome. And I can't imagine that this book ever got past an editor. Some of the prose was so poorly written I was literally laughing out loud. I rarely stop reading a book once I've started but with only 40 pages left of this 500 page novel, I gave up. I had no interest in the story or any of the characters and just couldn't stand to read another page.What a waste or real talent.",132
0,Not such a great textbook.,"I used this book as a textbook in a class. I feel that it is not really that strong of a book for most introductory polymer courses. I feel that either Alcock's book for a course stressing systhesis and characterization or Heimetz's book for courses stressing polymer physics are better. Of all the polymer books on my shelf, it is probably the least useful to me now. It is at the right level for begining students, but there are better choices for beginners out there.",85
0,A Romance for the Anti-Feminist,"I love vampire romances, however this entire series horrifies, and at times, sickens me. I wouldn't give it any stars except that it's required in the form.If the idea of ""justified"" rape and women born to belong to men is sexy to you, then this book, and the series, is for you. The men are all thinly disguised Neanderthals and the women are obedient doormats. Sure, they protest a bit at first, but soon they're all happy to belong to their men and do what they're told.I truly believe that people should be allowed to write and publish whatever they wish in our society, even if I personally disagree with it. However, the fact that young women are reading this and finding it sexy is truly disturbing. I fear for the future generation if they consider *this* to be the way men should treat women.Don't waste your money on this series. There are many other authors out there who write vampire romances without the need to make women subservient.",169

0,Such a disappointment.,I cannot remember ever being so angry at an author for jerking me around as I was with Jodi Picoult when I got to the end of this book. I was willing to ignore the ridiculous coincidences (such as Julia and Campbell both working on this case--are there only a dozen people in this town?--and Jesse's crimes affecting both Brian and the judge) and overly affected writing because the plot was so engaging. But Picoult's idiotic and gratuitous surprise ending is unforgivable. I can't believe I wasted a day reading this book only to be jerked around at the end.,100
1,Fair and balanced,"Biased supporters of either the Israeli or Arab leaderships will undoubtedly take issue with Jimmy Carter's take on the situation in the Middle East. My view is that he provides a fair and balanced view of historical developments in the area and the problems that need to be resolved. Like in any relationship it comes down to respect and trust, not an easy thing to achieve between two parties with such a history of hatred and suspicion. Still, in spite of the obvious difficulties Carter remains an unwavering optimist, a man of faith.",93
0,"Lame, derivative, puerile, and misogynistic","I tried to like this as a student asked me to read it, but I kept feeling like I've read this story before. Characters in the book do stupid, unbelievable things, and I ceased to care if they were killed; in fact, I sort of looked forward to it with a few of them. Names of characters seemed derivative, and I could not stand Kahlan. Her name seems like an amalgam of floor wax product names, and she is not a very strong character. I'm not surprised that the book did well however; remember the rule: ""People are stupid."" Maybe this refers to the people who bought this book?",109

I was assured that they would check the contents to be sure it was included. I got the next printer again without the USB cable (the printer is useless without the cable to hook it up to the computer). Since I do not want to be shipping back multiple printers I gave up trying to get a USB cable sent to me. I had to go to Best Buy to purchase a USB cable to use this printer and it cost me $35.00, guess this is why they are missing from the boxes.",133

1,Out of the ordinary Highsmith,"The creepy universes that flow from Highsmith's imagination are usually based in the everyday lives of ordinary people, and so it is with ""People Who Knock on the Door."" A small-town family is shattered when some members are born-again; there is a sense of danger and alienation not unlike ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers.""

0,This series is excellent,"I've watched this series on video from my local library, and it is a top notch documentary exploring the many phases of American Cinema. I wish I'd had access to a series like this when I was taking a university course in film way back in the late 70's.However, the price that these companies are asking for this series (from $225 to $1800 dollars) is totally bogus and ridiculous.A DVD costs less than a dollar, and you're asking for these absurd prices! A fair price would be maybe 50 dollars, but $1800?I hope that nobody is actually paying these prices from these sellers.",103

1,Fantastic ring!,I bought this ring to give to my boyfriend and when it came in the mail I feel in love with it so much that if he doesn't like it I am totally keeping it for myself! The ring seems to be true to size. The fact that it rotates makes it really cool and the way the whole ring is made seems pretty well done. I would definitely recommend this ring!,72
0,Disappointing,"Only good thing about this book is the intensity of the dialogue and the rich portrayal of characters, but this doesn't hold up till the second half of the book; the rest is cliche arguments that could in no way have come from the actual people involved in the setting. Pamuk really starts making characters say the things that are more stereotypical than actual, real, or even relevant to the discussion being portrayed. I agree with lots of the reviews here. The book does confuse and annoy. I left this book twice and read others then came back to it, each time with the hope I could see it with a fresh eye, until in the end I dropped it at the last quarter, too tired of the continuous dragging on and on which I assumed would only continue to the end, leaving me unsatisfied.May God bless my mother's soul, but it really would have helped if she'd taught me a thing or two about Turkish.

I dont think I have ever read such an entertaining non-fiction book in my life. The book realy tells it how it is. It lets you know the facts about how crooked our justice system is, and how powerful our government is. I would like to say ""Thank you"" to Mr. Klaber for writing such an enlightening book. I would now, after reading this book, rate Klaber up there with the other great writers of our time.

I don't know how Sony could stamp the Dolby Digital logo on this disk when it sounds as bad as it does. When I play it on my Onkyo DS-595 I get no center channel output and the bass is terrible. I have the SRV box set and it contains a DVD with songs from the same 1989 concert and it sounds like Dolby Digital should.,83
1,great book,This is an excellent book. It's easy to read and has a lot to say about relationships. Should be required reading for both men and women.,26
1,Quick light read,"This was the first book I have read by Jennifer Crusie, and I am very impressed. I will definitely be seeking out more of her works.I read the book in lightening speed because I was so caught up in the story. The humour added to the pleasure, and I just kept picturing Fred jumping through the window which in itself to me was comical (for those of you who have read it you will definitely know why).All the characters were likeable especially Nina. I did keep picturing Alex as this young frat boy type, but he was so good to Nina that his age became a non-issue. It is good to see an older woman attracting a younger man for a change rather than vice versa.Very good reading! You will definitely be pleased.",133
1,Love the Toy,"My granddaughter is 6 years old. When she first played the game she was so busy watching her cards, she forgot about the spoons. I believe this game will be very beneficial in teaching her to focus on more than one thing at a time. It is an older game, brought back with colorful spoons big enough for any child to enjoy. I would definitely recommend this game for family fun night.",72
1,Great book for those interested in West Point,"A very good book for those interested in attending the United States Military Academy.

1,Gluten Free Pantry Angel Food Cake Mix GREAT product,"I disagree with the person who gave this product only one star. I did find that I had to beat the cake longer than the box indicated and needed to bake it longer. I mixed my first one using my portable hand mixer which was really too small for this product. Second time I used my new stand mixer with the whip attachment. It more than doubled in volume after beating it about 10 minutes longer than the package suggested and I beat it on high. The cake filled my tube pan to the top and I baked it about 5 minutes longer than package suggested as my first one was a bit underbaked. My husband, who is NOT celiac, loves this cake also. We can't tell the difference between this one and a regular angel food cake mix. I also used 1 teaspoon of GF vanilla and 1 teaspoon of GF almond extract instead of using 2 of vanilla. I like the almond flavoring in angel food cake better, but that is personal preference.",175

1,Locked Room Classic,"Carter Dickson (also known as John Dickson Carr) created another wonderful golden age locked room mystery in his novel, The Judas Window. Sir Henry Marrivale is the sleuth and he is, as always, a dependable joy. The author has surrounded him with an able cast of supporting characters to help nudge the story along. The triumph, of course, and the reason for this book's existence is the locked room crime. Carter Dickson knows how to tease the mystery and drama out of this glorious cliche, making it seem fresh and new. This is a classic from a thrilling time in mystery writing by a true master of the form. Not to be missed.",113
0,"Too much endless guitar soloing, this isn't the Allmans","When Frank Marino sticks to songs and uses guitar soloing to improve their quality, like everthing from World Anthem to Full Circle, you get Robin Trower, Rory Gallagher etc at their best.When he uses a song as an excuse for endless guitar soloing, as in much of this recording, you get redundancy. Unlike the Allman Brothers, this is not quality jamming between band members.By the way, why does Amazon include a 'NO' in 'was this review helpful to you?'. People are only human and don't like opinions that differ from themselves. With some who are less mature, this the 'NO' makes it too easy express such displeasure.Are they trying to discourage negative reviews, hence not purchase the CD.

0,More is less,"About Face is largely a rant about examples of ineffective user interface design, with regular breaks along the way to expound upon some ""golden rules"" of user interface design. There's plenty here that's worthwile -- such as as hisarguments against the notions of ""metephor is good"" and ""modal is bad"" -- but it is spoilt by his poor writing style. Whereas Edward Tufte can concisely illuminate just the important elements, Cooper will labour for page after page over trivial points and then insist on trying to summate more complex interactions and subtle distinctions with clunky and trite generalisations. The examples and analogies are regularly unconvincing and sometime completely incorrect, such as when he tries to tell us the telephone was invented for business use. At nearly 600 pages, it's delivery ironicly echos one of its central points about user interfaces: more is less",143

I asked what had happened and he said he got into some yellow jackets on the tractor and the hat had come in handy to bat at them, Although it is tattered, he is still wearing it and it is serving the purpose so it is very well made.

1,fascinating story about the mysterious tradition of Geisha,"I first learned about this book from listening to Arthur Golden's interview on National Public Radios' ""Fresh Air"". A story about a Geisha written in first person by a western MAN sounded intriguing. A most difficult feat, but Golden manages to pull it off. In the interview, Golden described how he completed the research for this book and why his earlier attempt at writing in another voice besides first person failed. The details Golden adds when describing the rituals and training of young Sayuri, the Geisha-to-be is what I enjoyed most about this book. The Geisha tradition is very foreign to me as an American who has never traveled to the far east, and has limited exposure to Asian culture, firsthand. The story of Sayuri's life is very sad, but the reader is rooting for this strong willed woman to survive and overcome the tragedies of her early life. I think this book is destined to be a classic like Pearl Buck's ""The Good Earth.""",165

1,Marvelous musical canvas!,"I must confess that every time I decide to read a biography of the Great Painters of the past, I use to harmonize it with this enraptured music. The serenity emanated and the astonishing equilibrium of the form is simply unequaled.Frescobaldi was organist for excellence and exerted that office in San Pedro, Roma between 1604 until his death in 1643 with a brief period as organist in Florence between 1628 and 1634.His Canzoni constitute perhaps, the most refined evidence of his creative talent. Admirable from all standpoint. Fortunately for us, in the second half of the century XX there was a sudden interest about his musical legacy, that allowed to many ensembles as this fabulous and relatively recent (1979), or Andrew Parrot soloists have made possible the rediscover of such appreciated and many times forgotten gems of this Period.Perfect tonal balance and aristocrat musicality characterize this excellent ensemble. Go for this CD without dilation.",154
0,Hamish??,"When I started reading this book, I was aghast at how similar--nearly identical it is to the Hamish Macbeth series by MC Beaton, which I adore. And that's the problem.I spent the entire time reading this book comparing it--unfavorably--to the HM series. I saw that the Evan Evans series began in December of 1998, while the Macbeth series began publishing in Feb of 1999, so it's not as though MC Beaton saw this book and feverishly began working on copying it.MC Beaton's Macbeth series is just more humorous, the characters have more depth to them.This book was ok. Probably won't continue on in the series.",105

1,For those who are interested in the paranormal,"The Vampire chronicles are my favorite Anne Rice books and this book adds much to what has been written. She weaves history and facts with her fictional story so that the lines blur. One of the best books I've read this year. I'm a fan of the paranormal/supernatural in fiction and this is one of the best offerings right now. I also recommend in a somewhat similar yet very different vein, Robert Doherty's Area 51 series-- current paranormal in a complex and alarming story of things that border on the supernatural in 1998 America. His writing isn't as elegant as Rice's but the story is fast-paced and intriguing.",108
0,Form over Substance,"While Parton is incapable of recording a truly bad album (well, there was 1987's RAINBOW), this is a major letdown after the understated elegance of her recent folk/bluegrass work. The production is as over-the-top glitzy as her outfit on the cover, and the song selection is baffling. Rather than including the war-mongering ""Ballad of the Green Beret"", she would have been better off with Woody Guthrie's ""This Land is Your Land"" and ""Pastures of Plenty"", which would have been equally patriotic, but would also have been more in keeping with her last three albums. Instead, what she ended up with was an album that sounds like it's designed as a soundtrack for the next Republican convention.",116

All sorts of trying events, happy occassions and other significant life experiences occur but they had little impact as I did not really know nor care about many of the chacacters, although I wanted to.

If buying this pan/container, only use as a drain pan - not for storage or transport. I would recommend a regular drain pan with a large opening, as this one's opening is quite small.

1,This Book Stayed with Me,"This was my fourth or fifth Danielle Steel book to read and I think I loved this book much more than the rest. This story grabbed me and wouldn't let go. It stayed in my mind for 3 days straight after I first read it. The characters and their love story was the most heartbreaking thing I have ever read. He was married to an unloving wife which made him miserable and she was a young girl who didn't know what love was...until they met. I give this book 5 stars because it kept me interested and wanting more when I finsihed it. It isn't one of Danielle Steel's longer books, but it has a very compacted and dramatic story. When you start the book, it is told from the point of view of a character who is not named, but she is the pivitol beginning and ending of this story. It is the middle of the book that focuses on the two main characters who make up the love story.",171

I wish it could have had more reliable sources. Some of the internet ones no longer work. But it is a field in which you have to slide into under the cover of something else.. I know this since LGBT Middle East is my master's degree.. Besides the sources.. this is a real informative book, full of information.

While they were on the tenth planet, the Starmen discovered that the Benefactors have a vicious, implacable enemy - the Xenobots, a violent race that is searching for its 'ancient enemy' and will demolish Earth if necessary to further the search. Zip Foster organizes a desperate search to find the Benefactors before the enemy does. Without their help, Earth stands no chance against the technologically superior Xenobots. With impeccable logic, the Starman leader has determined that if the Benefactors had a central base in teh Solar System, it had to be on Europa, one of the moons of Jupiter. What the Starmen do not even suspect is that there is also a powerful enemy close to home.""",163

1,"Awesome toy esp. when you tape the ""money""","We first bought the ""Zillions"" cash register for our 4-year-old son, but we returned it right away because of its poor quality. This ""Learning Resources Teaching"" register is awesome! The size and materials are good, and it has great features. The electronic voice can't be turned off, but the volume can be controlled, and the voice is not annoying. I advise purchasers, upon receiving the register, to glue the yellow scale to its stand and pseudo-shellac the paper money by covering both sides with clear packing tape and then trimming off any excess with scissors. It works perfectly to preserve the money. I wasn't sure whether my son would like the built-in scanner (over the hand-held scanners included with some other registers), but he loves sliding household items across the button. The ""prices"" that show up for the scanned items are random, but this hasn't turned out to be a problem. Best toy cash register on the market!",158
0,Too much unnecessary sexual content & violence,"I was appalled by the violence and sexual content in this show. No there are no full on sex scenes but several scenes where it goes too far in my opinion. The violence is also over the top in my view. I found the acting to be good and the storyline to have potential, but just like Eick's ""reinvented"" Battlestar Galactica, the bad far outweighs the good. Apparently Eick's reinventions always require adding sex and violence in order to sell the reinvention. I will pass on this show. I am an avid sci-fi fan. I have enjoyed Star Trek, Babylon 5, Quantum Leap and many other sci-fi shows, none which needed to rely on sex and violence to sell the show.",121

1,Great Book by a Great Guy,"Joe Burn's is a unique technical author that writes as if he is talking to you. I recommend this book to anyone-that includes the non-technical folks--interested in setting up his/her own website. WHY? Because this book IS for beginners. It is written in a simple to follow, easy to read style. I wish more technical authors would follow Joe's simple style for their writing.

0,Fun to Read; Lousy History,"Truly a mess. No footnotes, lots of speculation, and plenty of cafeteria-style history (""I'll take one of these facts, and one of those...""). May appeal to the ""rum and strumpets"" fans but an absolute disaster of a 'history' book. If you want a book about the Crusades, stick with Runciman: not so much blood and garishness, but you won't be led astray. ""Dungeon, Fire and Sword"" is a dreadful book guaranteed to be warmly embraced by those who don't know any better.",82

This CD is stronger than their previous work.",123
0,The glamour of a looser??,"Some anthropologists argue that one of the characteristics of humans is the need to rationalise its actions no matter how absurd and contradictory they might be. Here, the main character decides to be a looser, as a consequence of its sexual ambivalence. However the would like to be nearby were the glamorous and the powerful gather to eat so he becomes a porter at the Four Seasons hotel in New York surviving from the tips offered by the wealthy patrons. So far so good as the topic of a novel. However, the author is incapable to offer a physiological portrait of Alexander Vine. The book is not disturbing, it is not funny, it is not shocking. You might get more insight about the sexual underground of New York watching 5 minutes of Sex and the City than from this book.",140
1,Best DT in years.,"This album is great, every song is played with alot of emotion and the instrumental is out of this world....Catchy and Melodic but Progressive and Technical at the same time....This is Dream Theater's best album since Scenes from a Memory IMO.",41
1,Another great one from Buble!,"Michael Buble has an amazing voice. This cd, his third full album is another great mix of classics and newer stuff. The single ""Everything"" is enough reason by itself to get the cd. There is something about that song that is pure joy. I love listening to it, and singing along with it. The classic Willie Nelson and Eric Clapton covers are lovely ballads. What a voice!",67

1,Rollicking good macho BS fun,"Russell Crowe is excellent as Captain ""Lucky"" Jack Aubrey, the head of the HMS Surprise. The movie details the skirmishes between the English Surprise and the French war ship, Acheron, set during the Napoleonic war. Captain Aubrey is a study in Leadership Values. He is a classic tragic figure, a hero with a fatal flaw. The revelation of the flaw is quite good but opposed to greek literature, Aubrey is finally triumphant not in overcoming his flaw but in that he is finally victorious (we believe) over the French ship. Oh well, I don't think it was intended to instruct us in higher moral values. Anyway, the movie is beautiful to look at, contains a dash of human interest (however, I did get a bit nervous about the lovely young men who served as midshipmen, etc), shows the comraderie that must have developed on such ships and from my 2004 perspective details daily life on board in an authentic manner. Recommended for a rousing good night of adventure.",168
1,fun enough,"This high quality game has lovely cards, a beautiful board, a fun 12-sided die, and very cool plastic dragon and dragonologist play pieces. This game is not too difficult to learn, and the play is fun. My one criticism is that winning winning is largely the result of luck. That is, die rolls and cards dictate how well you do, rather than strategy. Nevertheless, the ""cool"" factor elevates this game above other luck-based games.",74
0,Go back to the original published version!,"This ""uncut"" version, published thirty years after the original publication, shows how wise editors can be. The original ""Strangers"" is a great book, influencing a whole generation. The ""restored"" material in this version slows down the story, and its blatant sexism and dialogue are very offensive, dating the book. .",50
1,Wonderful break from mint!,"I love this toothpaste due to the flavor. I have searched for a good alternative to mint, and have found it in this flavor. I am having more difficulty finding it in stores, though. Very disappointing. Will continue to search in stores, though, as I have grown to rely on this flavor. (Mint makes me gag.) Would recommend this to adults who are tired of the typical mint toothpaste. (great for kids too)",73

I love the thickness of the pad and it has held up well for my husband and I since we bought it a few months ago. I took it right out of the box and put it on my bed, I didn't notice any chemical smell. It rebounds nicely, no more dents where our bodies rest. The quality of the pad is very nice and I was happy that it arrived quickly. Not too hard, not too soft. Overall I'm very happy with my choice!",112
0,Strong unit alright,"I'm sure this is a great unit but, unfortunately for me, this unit didn't work in my particular environment. I was using a handheld police radar unit. Approximately five minutes of being plugged into this unit, it managed to fry the power supply board and digital readout board. It cost me just under $275.00 to have the radar unit repaired. Use caution in what you plug into this unit.",69

Ms. Williams has presented another novel that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The characters, storyline, twists and turns, and the finale were just AWESOME. The pages came to life as she unfolded this satifying piece of work. She is definitely making a literary statement and I personally am hearing her, LOUD AND CLEAR. I can't wait for the next release.",85

1,Pretty Good.,"This book is great for beginning javascript programmers who have a clue how to program. It is definitely not great for someone to learn the skill of computer programming. Additionally the excersices are not very challenging(I've only gotten up to the chapter on arrays, but the other chapter excersices leave little room for creativity).The good thing about this book is that it is a great way to learn the syntax of javascript. It does not have a lot of information and it has about three excersices per chapter(of what I have read so far. Overall it is worth the price though.",101
1,The best vacuum cleaner I've ever used!,This is the first vacuum I've owned that leaves no trace of scent behind in the air after vacuuming. The HEPA filtration system is fantastic. The HEPA filter (Model 3282) works great and I didn't even have to replace it for over a year which is much longer than the 6 months they recommend. I own the Bissell Healthy Home 6100 Vacuum and I can say it is the best vacuum cleaner I've ever purchase. I used to own Hoover products but they really went down hill as far as the quality of manufacturing goes along with many other problems. This thing works equal to the top Dyson or Kirby but at a fraction of the cost!,117

1,Toby Marks rules,"While ""Last Train to Lhasa"" remains my all time favorite Banco de Gaia disk, ""Maya"" is the first public CD by BdG, and a superb introduction to the music. While Banco de Gaia, like many other ambient/techno entities, offers great dance beats, it soars above this basic form, creating something richer than most dance/dub/club sample music--something enticing and addictive that stands up to many repeated listenings...which is not something you can say about the majority of the music in the genre. Transcendent.",82

It went into the wee hours of the night and we watched the entire thing. This was to give to my children as a remembrance of that night when the Hall was opened here.,73
0,The Forgotten Album,"A lot has been written about this album, some good, some bad. This album (by U2 standards)is mediocre. Bono says himself that if they were starting out today and they released this as a second album, they would be dropped by the record label. A few highlights here like 'Fire','Gloria' and maybe at a push 'October', but other than that, nothing to write home about. Steve Lillywhite's production is raw and uneventful and the recording was 'rushed'. It is true that Bono's lyrics were stolen prior to recording which put added pressure on the limited resources that they had at the time. One to complete the collection but will probably not hit the CD-player too often.",116

1,The best battery charger I've owned!,"I give this 5 stars and would give it more if it were an option. This charger is FAST, usually less than 15 minutes. A great feature this has is that it has an internal fan to keep the unit and batteries cool. Everybody knows how fast temperture can ruin batteries. I like that there is a connection for the home or the 12v in vehicles. If your looking for a great charger... here it is.I actually bought two of these, one for a backup.",85
0,Good until the end,"While I've always found the theme of the ""Kingdom"" less personal that the King, this book does a good job of tracing that line of thinking through Scripture. My problem came with the author's end time view. It appears as if the author does not believe in a literal Millennium. He states on page 145 that it is, ""not meant to be understood literally."" If you hold to a literal view of the Millennium be aware that the author's view is different.",82

Maybe if you are into math formulas this will interest you. I found it anti-climactic. I kept wondering when something would happen and it never did. You never really get a solid answer in the end and it left me asking ""WTF?"" I would not watch it again unless I had insomnia and even then...",101

That said, this is a bad Cd by an even worse band. Don't buy it or anything by Pantera. You'll regret it. At least I got my money back to buy a Preist CD.",99

I would floss after using the water-flosser and would still find a very small amount of food particles. However it did impart a feeling of 'clean' and I liked using it.THE REALLY BAD: It stopped recharging in less than a year. The company replaced it with another which also stopped recharging in less than a year! The overall design is not as functional as it should be. It is difficult to take apart for cleaning or to change the tip.Bottom line: I miss using it but expensive, considering its short lived life.",112
0,Don't WASTE your money!,"Sounds like a good idea, but this thing just does not work very well.....it's like listening to an FM station that you ALMOST get...signal goes in and out, while other stations bleed through.

1,great fan if you dont mind the noise,I recently purchased this fan as a replacement for my vornado. When compared to my vornado I feel that this fan moves as much air but definitely isn't as quiet. While it's not as noisy as cheaper box fan alternatives I don't recommend using it as your bedroom fan while trying to sleep unless your used to the sound. The fan itself looks very well made and has an extremely solid feel to it. I have had this fan for a little over a year ago and am still as happy with it as the day i got it. If your looking for a decent priced fan that can move alot of air this is it.,116
1,"Good overall, but needs some doctoring.","This is a great sheath for any of the Leatherman Juice series multi-tools. The only drawback is the fact that it clips onto the belt, rather than having a loop for the belt to slide through. This feature makes it easy to slip off and lose your Leatherman.aboutTo fix the problem, simply do what I did: tear off a piece of black duct tape about 12-inches long, and cut it longways in half. Then, taking one of the thin strips of tape, wrap it around the bottom of the sheath, creating a closed loop through which to slide your belt.With this slight doctoring, I never have to worry about losing my sheath and Leatherman XE6.",115

1,Replay value is off the charts,"One of only a few shows I can honestly say that I have watched many times through. I love Michael Hall and have loved him since Six Feet Under. It was hard to see him as a straight man in this serious for an episode or two and then I got used to it. That was the only hitch but not anyone's fault. People write horrible reviews for Dexter because their sense of morality feels to be in jeopardy by watching it. Its a great show. Depth, cliffhanger suspense, peril, gritty insight into each character as the seasons pass, unexpected twists. You really cant get better television than you get with Dexter. By far my favorite show ever put on the screen. Blu ray is definitely worth the extra few dollars as it is masterfully done both in sound quality and picture clarity. I LOVE THIS SHOW.",147
0,"Watch out, other Petzyl Tikkas are great, but not this one!","I've depended on Petzyl Tikkas for daily use for years, and didn't even understand how there was variation between them, considering they are named the same. But this one does not have the button for 3 light settings (hi, lo, blink), it just has on/off, which for me is too bright for reading with new batteries. It also is somehow made with inferior machining (or mine are bad luck) because for 1st time this one doesn't provide steady light, but occasionally flickers a bit like the connections are iffy. Which is more irritating than it may seem. Not like a candle, more like a constant reminder to swat your head and see if the thing gets fixed. So, go for the slightly more expensive Tikkas that have the button, not slide switch, and have never in my history of owning 6 flickered.",142
1,"worth a read, but not worth the price","an entertaining and insightful, if short, glimpse into the lifestyle, if not life, of one of the greats of the west coast jazz scene of the early 1950s. the lack of details leads me to believe what was published here is, in reality, only an outline for a book which never quite materialized. a shame because this book gives you just enough information to make you realize that baker's life story would indeed make not only a great book, but movie as well. unfortunatly, there is hardly any material of substance here and the entire book could be read in less than an hour and a half. i would recommend it to those with an interest in the west coast jazz scene who are interested in a first-hand supplement to other, more in-depth, if after-the-fact, volumes on the subject. but i would suggest that, with only about 60 pages of actual text you would be better off reading it in the book store or checking it out from the library.",170

1,"Good, but Ten was better","This album is pretty good. I don't like it as much as I liked Ten, but there's some really awesome songson this one. ""Go"", ""Animal"" and ""Daughter"" are especially good. Mike McCready plays some awesome solos. He's great with a wah wah pedal. Stone keeps playing the original rythym riffs he's know for. Eddie always gives a great vocal performance. Pearl Jam is definitely my favorite grunge band. But overall, this album just didn't have the same effect on me that Ten did. That doesn't mean it's not worth buying though, I'm glad I have it.",96

If you do buy this and get it assembled, try not to move it around too much, as it may fall apart. Also, the drawers are very shallow. Don't expect to store much in this.

The lining is very soft and comfortable and the gloves have a lot of mobility, and slide on and off the hand easily.I think they changed the construction of the product versus what's described and pictured. Instead of ""Thinsulate"" mine came with ""Thermofill"" insulation, and doesn't have the ""Thinsulate"" tag. Still very warm though, and still 100% polyester insulation.Oh and while they're not for heavy abrasive work, they're still tough enough for most things I would use gloves for. On the other hand the deerskin is super soft, so I could see it getting scratched, embedded with dirt, etc. really easily. I think they're tough enough for light-to-moderate tasks and just for keeping your hands warm while doing them.",160
0,total hogwash,"This writer is still at a very rudimentary level of spiritual awareness and completely deluded about his own degree of perceptivity and insight.The most ridiculous aspect of this book is that he equates high socio-economic status with spiritual accomplishment. IOW, if you deliver the mail, you are at a low spiritual level, if you are a CEO, you are at a high level, closer to Jesus and the Buddha. That would of course be the Jesus who worked as a carpenter!I believe that the purpose of life is spiritual growth and we choose our families based on the lessons we need to learn in that incarnation. I doubt there is much correlation between income and spiritual accomplishment. There are many beings of great light, who will live their lives in complete obscurity, as they polish the last remaining vestiges of pride, self-will and fear off their noble souls.",148
1,Very Underrated Game,"BMX XXX is alot like the Dave Mirra series. If you are not familiar with the series, Dave Mirra BMX games have tight controls,huge levels and creative tasks to complete. BMX XXX is not as good as Dave Mirra, but mirrors alot of it's traits. The controls are not as tight but they are not shot. The graphics are about the same as is the size of the levels. The tasks you have to complete are actually better in this game because they add funny,crude funny but funny, tasks that you will want to complete just to see the reactions of the characters in the game. Don't buy this game if your looking for nudity though, there isn't much. But if your looking for a good BMX game, this is it. Not great, but good.",135
0,Nothing shocking here.,"As for the editorial review, that guy must be high to even mention the frontwoman of this band and Chrissie Hynde in the same sentence. I usually don't even read the editor reviews on Amazon because I have not found one that actually critizes any of the bands or musicians they review. I don't know about you but can every single group in the world be good. As far as this album goes, it is a definant turn for the worse for these guys, in fact aside from their first works they really havn't done anything of value. In my opinion they should have left the catalog just the way it was.",112

0,Predator prompts first-ever review...,"As an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell's novels, I eagerly dove in to 'Predator.' I would rate it as an average thriller, but it definitely missed the mark in the ongoing Scarpetta series. No closure to any of character issues;dark and brooding interactions that generated little sympathy for Lucy, Scarpetta, or Marino; and an ending that made me say ""so what?""",61
0,First review but I had to warn others...,"I wanted so badly to like this case. It has a small slot to put my debit card, license, and my insurance card. And that's what I really wanted (an ""all in one on the go"" case so i don't have to carry my wallet when I go to the store)When I first had the case the phone fit snugly and worked well... UNFORTUNATELY it just started to fall apart after just a couple weeks. The clip (like many others here have said) wore away and basically ripped off. Now I have to be very careful as the phone will sometimes fall off my belt. I returned the product and got another one thinking ""okay maybe I had a lemon""... nope same exact thing happened. The leather stitching wore away and the belt clip basically fell off again. Fool me once shame on you... fool me twice shame on me. So now I'm on Amazon looking for something else that will serve my needs. If you're looking for a hip case I would definitely move on from this one and look for something more secure.",185

1,Drop it in your pocket.,"I am completely satisfied with this product. I started using pedometers several years ago in order to get some idea of how much I walked each day and to motivate myself to walk more. However, I never really felt comfortable strapping one onto my belt at work and I was constantly taking it on and off to see how far I had walked. This product is simple to use---just drop it in your pocket and forget about it. It takes up little space and is very easy to use. It also seems to be very accurate. Furthermore, I like that it resets itself automatically at midnight each day and allows you to check back easily on the past 6 days' results. The aerobic feature is very useful too as it allows you to distinguish regular steps from ""aerobic steps."" I have had several pedometers over the years but this, by far, is the best and the easiest to use.",159

0,Strawberry Shortcake: The Berryfest Princess,"My 2+ year old daughter didn't like this animated cartoon of Strawberry Shortcake as the characters looked different from the original cartoon series. She couldn't recognize Blueberry Muffin and insisted that wasn't her. Also, Pupcake has green polka in this animation, while its blue polka in the original. And they weren't many songs in this animated cartoon. I thought the songs were the main attraction for this cartoon. So, my daughter didn't find it interesting, rather boring with too much dialogue.",81
0,Couldn't Finish It!,"I am greatly surprised by the positive reviews this book generated. It started off with an interesting premise, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks trying to rise to the top of the business world, but the novel sagged midway inexplicably. The suspense and interest for me stopped. The characters became dislikable. I found it hard to generate sympathy for pampered, whiny twenty something year-olds. Yes, Laura was treated unfairly by being stripped of her inheritance, but her and Clay reacted to this as if it were a major catastrophe. Clay is a spoiled brat while Laura is cold and uninteresting. Why Paul and Wex find this bland woman so fascinating is beyond me. It also became tiresome to read about the characters' outlandishly wealthy, privileged lives. They seemed to live a fake, superficial existence. The writing team of Judith Michael succeeded in doing only one thing with this novel. They made the lives of the rich and famous look incredibly shallow.",164
0,Should Have Stayed Bachman,"In his typical fashion, Stephen King leads us to believe in the first few paragraphs that he may have finally returned to the voice that we all fell in love with. Sadly, this is not the case.""Cell"" is as badly contrived a novel as I could have ever imagined. One-dimensional characters, a farcical style and voice, his ever-present use of slang words for anatomy, and his creepy penchant for including teenaged girls in his stories. King's use of street-level geography bogs down the reader, making us concentrate more on where his characters are physically rather than where they are emotionally. Anyone unfamiliar with Massachusetts is apt to put down the tome in a few minutes, once they get past the macabre opening scenes in which people jump from skyscrapers and gnash at each others' throats with their teeth.Unfortunately, the days of the King are gone, leaving us all wishing for Bachman in all his glory.",155

1,"Take this seriously, seriously","Ostensibly country and western, Stompin' Tom belongs more rightly to the binomial ""metropolitan and hinterland"", the urban vs. small town axis that marks the Canadian landscape. Stompin' Tom (the name comes from his literal big foot stomping while playing guitar, made famous in the 70's) writes extraordinarily funny songs rich in ultra-local colour and disarming simplicity, which makes some wonder if this guy's serious. So much so that he stopped playing altogether for some 15 years because ""people don't take me seriously"", dedicating himself to producting and other such stuff. Popular acclaim has drawn him somewhat back to his pale limelight. For music buffs the closest American reference would be Jonathan Richman (as with Richman, it really doesn't matter which CD you listen to). One of those quirky Canadian thangs that Americans occasionally (like Moosehead -remember?- beer) get a taste for.",141

John Young, Edgar Mitchell and David Scott also evoke emotional responses but in a vastly more subtle and understated manner. I could have done without Aldrin and Cernan, both of who continue to exhibit tremendous self-regard all these decades.A very personal film that is a worthwhile collection to any space buff's library. Also, it is a good movie for those who did not live thru that era but wish understand some of the men inside those machines.",121

You won't be able to mosh or anything at their shows, but you can have DAMN good time just listening to them play live. As for just the album itself, songs such as ""Cowboy Hat"" and ""Leader of Men"" give you that Alice In Chains/Matchbox 20 feel. Good, laid back rock album! And a VERY powerful vocalist. Just so you know, the lead singer told me that ""Leader of Men"" is about KILLER MUSHROOMS. Well, I'm not into drugs or anything, but it seems these guys love a good joint every now and then; but you can't bash 'em for that.

0,Repugnant Rubbish,"Just when you thought the French couldn't sink any lower along comes Irreversible. Told in reverse this film is essentially a tale of revenge however unlike other films in this genre this film lacks any class and goes straight for the juggular. Whilst much of the debate over this film surrounds the infamous 10minute rape sequence, an act of violence towards the start of the film is perhaps the most violent and reprehensible scene ever committed to celluloid. Stobe lights and crazy camera movements drive the viewer to reach for the sick bag rather than be dazzled by the director's attempts at stylistic meaning and the main characters are all shallow, unlikeable people. This film is an ugly and pretentious attempt at displaying the darker side of human nature and the concepts of fate and time however ends up wallowing in its own sordid mess losing any messages it was trying to make in the process.

Bashing Carter's Presidency, former profession, et al is nothing but shooting the messenger and ignoring the facts on the ground. Until the moderates in all camps start to have more influence we will have nothing but more bloodshed. Imagine Northern Ireland with Ian Paisley calling the shots.

There was virtually no advertising or information about this film when it first came out. It just showed up on the shelves at blockbuster and people had to take a chance on it. I'm glad I did, because it is one of the best original science fiction films of the 90s. Charlie Sheen was terrific as the nerdy scientist Zane. Zane works for NASA and when he brings some strange readings to his bosses they ignore it and fire him. Unwilling to let it go, Zane travels to Mexico to uncover the truth, and you won't believe what he finds. It's a strong cast and a great story that is full of surprises.

0,EVER HEAR OF TREBLE?,"As previous reviews have pointed out the mix on this cd is absolutely horrible. The guitar is so muddy it's flat out annoying to listen to. Someone either didn't know there was a treble knob on the amp, tone knobs on the guitar or how to operate a mixing board. Go get Pat's early solo cd's like El Hombre or East; you can't go wrong with either one.

0,BEWARE if you are in Denver/Boulder - no TV Guide listings,"I have owned this unit for nearly two years, have called customer support several times (they are friendly and fairly knowledgeable) and have never been able to use TV Guide listings because of an apparent incompatibility with Comcast's signal and this unit. Now, I can ""rent"" a DVR unit from Comcast that DOES work with their TV Guide signal (a Panasonic even!) but I dislike the idea of getting rid of this unit after investing a decent amount of $$ into it. If it weren't for this major problem, I'd be very happy with the unit.",96

Nor has he ever said he *disagrees* with what he was ""simply quoting."" How people can listen to a song like ""Peace Train"" or ""Wild World"" and force that from their minds is hard to understand, outside of nostalgia or historical interest...

0,Some good points but difficult to read...,"While this author has some good points and wisdom to share it is a very difficult read because it is horribly wordy. The author seems to go on and on and on about each topic/point. I found it very boring and difficult to read (and I love to read self-help books and have quite a collection of them). I think that the author should have either hired a ghost writer or the editor should have done a better job of cutting the wordiness out of the text. I finally started reading the summaries at the end of the chapters instead of the chapters itself. This had the potential to be a good book if it had been written in an easy read format.

Nowadays, it's showing it's age compared to the newer incarnations like the Archos 5 and 7, etc but this unit is built solidly, it's held up to abuse and the screen looks nice and bright and is durable. I still use mine from time to time, thought it's plagued with issues because the batteries for this thing last about a year before rapidly losing capacity. I've never had too much trouble with it locking up but if you save an HD MP4 file on it, it locks it up because it's trying to thumbnail the video. It's not meant for HD though, just DVD resolution files.",124

I have to say this is the worst workout DVD of the twenty or so I own for a number of reasons:-The segments are billed as 20 minutes each, but according to my DVD timer, the arms segment only ran 15 minutes.-The workout was too easy. I didn't sweat, my heart rate didn't rise, and my arms didn't get sore. You don't use any weights.-The moves were hard to learn and there weren't verbal cues to tell you when to move to your left, right, etc.-The instructors are amateurish and their ""we're so cool"" banter is extremely annoying. They often missed steps. This seemed more like something someone would post on Youtube than a serious workout video.Save your money!",134

0,Worked OK while they lasted.,"Sound is better than most stock earbuds, and they are very good at shutting out external noise. Takes a bit of work to get them sized up & fitted correctly, and after that it still takes a while to get used to them. If you get them fitted in your ears just right, they have good frequency range for earbuds, but if you don't, the sound quality seriously suffers.Would have been happy enough with them but after about six months, sound from the left earbud failed. Got them pretty cheap so it's hardly worth it to try to RMA them, even if they are still under warranty. I have the HD580 and HD560 Sennheiser headphones and the sound on those is fantastic and they will last forever. A big reason why I bought these is because I thought I'd get the same sort of quality in these earbuds. It's disappointing to see Sennheiser put their name on an unreliable product.",160

1,Living Chess,"What makes Life and Death in Shanghai so captivating is the seemingly unlimited thought put into its writing. Since Nieng Cheng's quick and cunning analytical thinking was her only available weapon of self-defense, she spared neither time nor effort in analyzing every minute detail of her surroundings. Cheng's conversations with her interrogators at the detention house resembled a real-life chess game played between two grand masters. Both parties spent days, weeks, or even months formulating a defensive and offensive strategy. Life and Death in Shanghai leads the reader though a plethora of original logical thoughts and conclusions, not unlike the deductions of Sherlock Holmes, which give the story an almost fictional feel. This book will be of interest to both casual and critical readers. Highly recommended.",126
0,SAVE YOUR $$$$$$,I played this game at my friends house and I thought that it was pretty boreing. First of all the game play isn't good at all . I thought the graphics were good. The game play is like Socom but set in the future. The should have a couple more and better weapons. The rounds are stupid because when your the last one alive on your team you lose which is stupid because your still alive against say two more droids and you lose. I was going to buy it at first but when I played it at my friends house I thought h*** no.But thats my opinion for this game. If you like it thats fine,117

If you like Oasis or Coldplay(both from the UK), this is your next stop on the road to music satisfaction.BEWARE: Bitter Sweet Symphony is only one of about three songs that's background music if electronic on this cd.

1,"melancholic, kick-ass Southern boys","I browsed through some of the previous reviews, and frankly, I can't understand the comparisons with the Strokes. These bands aren't even remotely similar, other than the fact that they reside outside of the mainstream (thank God).That said, I highly recommend this album if you like intelligent, bittersweet rock'n'roll from Dixie like the Allman Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd, or newer bands like the Drive By Truckers, My Morning Jacket, and Black Crowes. That's not to say that Kings of Leon sounds much like any of these bands, just that they have a similar attitude towards life & faintly similar musical styles. Perhaps what they all have in common is the ability to smoothly change song dynamics, from an acoustic-driven, bittersweet song (or part of a song) to frenzied rock.I also love the singer's voice (whichever Followill brother is singing, pardon my ignorance), particularly when he screeches and raves like a madman. It's what rock'n'roll is all about.",156

I bought it on a whim after I heard the song ""Outlined In Black"", but let me tell you -- this thing is unbelievable from start to finish.

The colors are already collated, so you don't have to do that bit of work. These files seem very sturdy and the card stock they are made of seems like they should last a long time.I prefer different colored file folders for a few reasons. Sometimes I remember what color the file is and with all of the files and junk in my drawer it isn't easy to find. So I look for the color and the tab to try and find my file. Also different colored files can prevent filing something in the wrong file by accident, which is when things get lost forever! If you have some files with a lot of paperwork, this is the way to go. The papers sit nicer in the file and it is easier to dig through your file when it's not all smashed together.",173
0,NOTHING like the book!,"Brian Greene has no greater fan (except maybe his mother), and his magnificent book The Elegant Universe is phenomenal. I expected this tape to discuss some of the perplexing issues relating to superstring and M theory. Instead I ended up with something made to appeal to grade school children--lot's of goofy special effects and only the most cursory treatment of the subject. If you expect to learn anything from this video, you'll be bitterly disappointed. The only reason I gave it even one star was because it was nice to actually see and hear the author--a truly brilliant scientist who possesses the rare gift of illuminating complex subjects for the general public. Get the book instead. After you read The Elegant Universe, get his next book, The Fabric of the Cosmos. Forget about this ridiculous, juvenile video.

My 2 Star rating has nothing to do with Lautenburg or her group but everything to do with marketing and packaging. These are NOT the complete Brandenburg Concertos, no matter what the previous reviewer thinks. Concertos 2, 3, 4 & 5 are each missing 1 or 2 entire movements.Also, despite what this person says, Glenn Gould never conducted or played on any recorded version of the Brandenburgs, let alone one with poor sound quality.",126
1,Very Good Game,If your a fan of the Diablo or Baldurs Gate series then you should do yourself a favor and check out Dungeon Siege. This game is basically a cross between Diablo and Baldurs Gate and incorporates features from both games. This game adds new twists on the RPG genre when in that in most RPG's you choose whatever class you want to be from the start and cannot change. In Dungeon Siege this is not so. Your skills and classare determind by how you play.My favorite feature of the game is the fact that once you are inside the game world you do not have to load additional levels. Gone are the loading between levels of Diablo and the disc swapping of Baldurs gate. This is a very good game and one that you will not regret buying.,138

In the old CD, Nelly tried new things and experimented with bass in ways other rappers hadn't. He stood out from the crowd - but in his latest release, he seems to have sold out to produce a mediocre effort, which sounds exactly like the product of every other black guy with a microphone who's told he has ""talent"". I'm sorry Nelly, but your new CD just doesn't stack up to the original. Try again.1/5 stars",104

0,Not as good as I remember...,"Sadly, I must agree with the majority of reviewers. This series does not translate well. It lacks focus in its directing, tension in its writing and the picture quality is rather poor. Too bad, as it is from 1959. Fonda must have indeed needed the money and it was, as was written, ""an easy gig"" for him. Nice performance by Allen Case, who sadly never did much more on screen, but did have his moments on(off?) Broadway and unfortunately died in his fifties of a heart-attack. And Robert Redford has a nice guest spot in one episode, but still it is not worth the asking price. Incidentally, I bought my set for $19.99 from a local retailer. So $31.99 is definitely out of line!How about a set of Bat Masterson?! And this time re-master it!!!",135

0,Disappointed and disillusioned,I purchased this set just under a year ago from Kmart and it worked great up until a couples months ago. I recently got cable service and so had to hook the tv up to the cable box; that night I noticed a high pitched humming noise and realized it was coming from the tv. Two days after hooking up the set the remote controls (both for the cable - which was now programmed to control the tv - and the original tv control) no longer turned the set on immediately. I now have to stand there and press that ON button at least 15 times before the set actually turns on. I disconnected the set from the cable and unplugged it for an entire day hoping it would reset itself but to no avail. The set still humms incessantly when turned off and takes an eternity to turn on. I HATE THIS TV. Olevia's customer service sucks. Their idea of offering advice is to tell me to try pluggin it into another outlet...which I'd already tried and it FAILED.,180

Honor loosely follows Horatio but both are great fictional characters and ""The Honor of the Queen"" will back me up on that.

I reommend that if you are looking for a good Online game for X-Box get Counter-Strike there is a good game and the graphics are good but that dosent matter gameplay rocks better then soldier of fortune and add's a new twist to theses first person shooters and scoreboards makes people try harder so go out by counterstriek my friends,139

0,"Despite the good cause, do not buy this for small children .","This book is a retelling of the classic story by a few dozen celebrities writing and performing (on the CD that comes with it)the parts of the various characters in the book. I was not at all happy to find that a book that is certainly meant for small children contains much that I found inappropriate for my 4 year old and even my 8 year old. This collaboration turns out to be an opportunity for some well meaning, but clueless, celebrities to entertain and impress each other. Many of the characters are needlessly mean spirited and vulgar. Between the 'potty' humor of Robin Williams to the use of the term 'schmuck' by Fran Drescher there is plenty to make me put this book/CD in the trash. There were several classy and thoughtful contibutions including those from Angela Lansbury and Nathan Lane, but this was not enough to make up for the other shortcomings.If you like the cause send in the $30 and tell them to keep the book and the CD.",172

1,Oh man....,"this album is cool. How shall I explain this album. It is filled with pop songs that mostly sound the same from each other but are stripped down until they are nothing but vocals, a guitar onslaught, and amazing, amazing white noise. This album even goes further with The Velvet Underground's ideas that they founded and makes it a bit more glossier and beautiful. You can slightly sense more of The Velvet Underground with the lyrics, they are both dark and about drugs and dying. But it isn't completely devoid of songs with cheer in them. The album starts out with the amazing Just Like Honey and this sort set the playbook for the rest of the album. This album is practically flawless and you should buy this and let is set in, and you won't be let down at all, if it hits you right it will become one of your favorite albums.",154

Ater 9/11, I honestly thought the director would try to gloss up firefighting and veer away from the hard realities, sacrifices and sheer courage required by those men who choose to stay the course, day in and day out.Instead, this movie had integrity, heart and, just as importantly, a riveting story. Told from the perspective of a rookie firefigher and his captain, it careened from one exciting moment to the next but also showed the toll firefighting can take on marriages and personal lives. I was often moved to tears and the teenagers who saw it with me were riveted and inspired. We need more movies like this.",135

I must say though, I truly appreciate the author's fluid use of words and let the words flow through me as I read it, but honestly, after reading all of the reviews on the book jacket of this book, I was disappointed that as an avid reader of quality literature, I did not find this book to be as good as the many reviews.",122

And while I hate to disillusion the poor readers who've previously bought this book before reading this review, I must say we do not speak the way the author would like us to (as this would make for a less interesting story). I feel that if the author WAS indeed ostracized, her attitude about South Dakotans must've shown through in her interactions with us. I saw this book as nothing but a running rant on the citizens of our state, while begging for a pity party. I was hard-pressed to find three consecutive sentences that didn't contain a barb toward her hometown. The author does at times laugh at herself. But probably not nearly as often as the townspeople laughed at the author. Now that she's written the book and gotten all of her frustration out, I hope the author can live here in peace. But I doubt it. We are, after all, able to read.",169

The situation was a typical sequence for a child getting really angry. But who would let their young child out to roam that far (even in make believe) when they are so upset? This option is not a safe, satisfying or rectifying option for angry children. Indeed, the underlying message is ""Go away if you're upset, we don't want you around here!"" I would love to see this storyline suggest that a parent (or significant adult) will help by trying to understand the child, help the child feel calm again, and show the child ways to gracefully recover from intense emotions.",121

I don't care so much about the smoking but it seemed almost over the top, like Johnny Depp in the Ninth Gate. 1.99 would have been a fair price but 3.99 was too much.

This book could be read as pure escapism with a loveable group of unreliable scoundrels. It could also be seen as an early example of beat writers, albeit with a slower pace. But it belongs on all American fiction lovers shelves. It is one of those reads that will stay in most readers hearts and souls.",116

1,Easily misunderstood but groundbreaking,"This book is written for scholars of political science, not for casual readers or the anti-establishment. Claes Ryn describes a movement throughout Western politics that he calls the neo-Jacobins. The neo-Jacobins bear a resemblance to Rousseau in the sense that (1) they advocate the eradication of tradition and political and individual restraint, (2) their morality is such that they are always right, and anyone who opposes them is wrong. Neo-Jacobin thinking permeates through intellectual elites who stand to gain power from the two points above. The one criticism I have is that his description of the Jacobins may not be taken seriously because it comes across as a ""conspiracy."" In fact, it is not a conspiracy, and many of the Jacobins are not aware that they are or have not thought carefully about where they stand. Still, such a manner of presentation may discourage serious readers from accepting his views.",150

When you listen to the load album you can only stare at your stereo in disbelief comparing it to this.'Fade to Black' is a magnificent song- Metallica's first acoustic song.'For Whom The Bell Tolls'is my personel fav on the album with its thundering bass lines courtesy of the brilliant Cliff Burton and the song's poetic lyrics.I would say it is Metallica's darkest album whilst it does not have quite the same conviction and complexity as the subseqeunt 'Master of Puppets'.'The Call of Ktulu' is a genius instrumental to close the album- an eight minute epic if ever there was one.Yep it don't get much better than this.,136
1,Lengthy but good.,"A very long and in depth book on Japanese cooking. But if you want to truly learn about the origins of why and how things are done, it is a must have. This is not your basic take off the shelf and look up a recipe cook book. It is a cook book/history book.",54

1,Not like the live stuff from her Web site,"If you like Rickie Lee, make sure you visit her web site whereshe sells MP3 live recordings, direct to you. There you willfind the opposite of this one: quieter, looser, quirkier. Theofferings there (www.rickieleejones.com) are also often completeshows. This one *is* as the other reviews suggest: (high-)powered, poppy, punchy. The thing is, I don't know Rickie Leeand neither do you (and neither do these other reviewers). Sowho can comment on her wishes, and who knows but what she wantsall of these sides of her performance persona exposed. In thisperformance, she took pains to put together a *very* slick band,complete with muted trumpet ornaments, multi-part harmonies,etc. And it rocks. And if you feel like complaining about theslick production, save your breath and your time, go to herwebsite, and download the quiet sensitive stuff until yourfingers go numb. That stuff is great, too!",141

0,Iron Yoga,"I have to be honest, I've only used this DVD twice. I found it to be very boring and unmotivating. It wasn't a good strength workout and it wasn't a good yoga workout. They tried to combine the two and it didn't work for me. When I do yoga I feel a sense of well-being and my body feels like it has benefitted from head to toe. This didn't give me that feeling at all! When I lift weights, I can definately feel that I have accomplished something and my muscles are fatigued. This video didn't do that for me either. Maybe it works for some people, but I didn't enjoy it. Also, I think you have to be careful in some of the poses with the added weight.....careful not to put more strain on your lower back.",138

1,Very Good Album,"I enjoyed listening to this album...I just think that whatever label they're on should promote them more, because you don't see or hear much about them, and they are better than a lot of these groups out today.

1,Psychic Attunement working for me!,"I took the Psychic Attunement several times. It did take a few weeks after receiving the Attunements before I did notice an improvement in my psychic abilities, and my psychic abilities keep on improving with time. Taking the Psychic Attunement has been successful for me. I'm buying the Psychic Attunement Vol. 2 DVD to take my Psychic abilities to the next level. The few negative reviews I spotted for this DVD you can tell are from skeptics to begin with, and their reviews show they did not give the Attunement time to work. If you are a skeptic and/or and want instant psychic abilities, I do not recommend this DVD because the attunement does not work that way...it's a process. I do recommend the DVD if you are really interested in developing your psychic abilities because it's a great tool to help develop your psychic abilities.",146
0,Follow The Link......And Save,"I may be missing something, but I own a pair of Cobra PR-4200s also made by Cobra. Other than the fact that the faceplate on the 4100s is blue, they appear to be exactly the same radio. Same range, appearance, weather option, features, everything. They are except for the color exact duplicates. The only big exception is the vast difference in price. The 4200s are $25 brand new, while you can't even get a pair of these refurbished for that price. The new price for them was listed at $70 as of this writing. If you are at all considering these radios I strongly advise you to follow the link enclosed and check out the 4200s. I left a very favorable review for them for both performance and price. They're an excellent basic two way radio, and the very cheapest radios with the NOAA weather option available on Amazon as of this writing...Cobra PR-4200-2WX VP Micotalk 18-Mile Range 2-Way Radio - 2 Pack",163

0,Hon Task Chair,"I owned a Hon task chair for over 30 years. The only reason I needed to replace it was that the seat padding had deteriorated. EVERYTHING else about the chair was in excellent condition. So I didn't hesitate to buy another Hon. It's the last one I'll ever buy. Although it looks identical, and the description says it's identical to my previous chair, those are the only things remotely similar. This chair is cheap, poorly made, with inferior materials. The seat padding is so close to non-existent, it's like sitting on a rock. The movements work so poorly, I won't be the least bit surprised if they stop working altogether. The best thing I can say about this chair is that it looks good. Caveat emptor definitely applies here.",129

I tested everywhere including in house, on the road, airport etc. The avg download is about 400K and upload 140K. These are significantly slower than what I was promised at the store and the results of my tests when I first bought it (800K/400K).I called Verizon. The tech support guy was very rude and basically said this speed is normal and ""broadband"". He also tried to come up with excuses such as you are indoor although he had to agree that my signal strength was good. He also said as long as you could connect, you couldn't argue because there was no promise of the speed on the contract. (So basically even if your speed was 1K, they wouldn't see a problem with it.)My conclusion, I will never use Verizon again.",150

My set had some unsightly chafing marks which I buffed out with headlight lens compound.This set had the same problem with preventing windows closing that my previous set had in that the sharp edge on the bottom corners of the rear window shades hung up on the top edge of the glass when rolling up the windows which prevents closing.

I tried it for an entire month before giving up and going back to something else. The main issues I see with the item include: its not nearly as customizable as it should be, the bit wings are too thick, and all the pressure from grinding is isolated on just a few teeth. This last issue causes tooth pain and not just the usual soreness. Purchase a custom dental guard from your dentist if you can afford it.

Yet it is frightening to be in an age where people will grasp such superficially degrading images. Geddes has made a personal fortune off photographing babies, subjects usually positioned in inhumane circumstances (ie: babies in flowerpots or dipped in custard), which removes human dignity and allows us to question Geddes moral intent.",126

No one can act, they all do stupid things that no one not in a horror movie would do and Jason just walks around slaughtering everyone.

That might not seem like much, but for me ( I am over 30 ), it is a BIG accomplishment. As for all these negative reviews, my guess is they either didn't even try the techniques correctly, or they are written by this books competitor.

1,What an excellent revival!!!!,"I loved this game back in the olden NES days. When this game came to the GBA I was very impressed with what has been done with it, there is no downfalls, only improvments!! The game is just the way I remember it with a few add ons here and there... a very excellent game revivalof the super woggio brothers 3!Tho the name is confusing, it's Mario Advance 4. Yet it's Super Mario Bros. 3Another cool thing about this version, as well as a few other things, if you have a gameshark, there is a code where you can use the flying cape from Mario world (4)!!!",107

0,Extended Version Held Hostage,"I believe that the studios are trying the same old tricks. First sell the theatrical version and milk it for all it is worth, then release the extended version and create new ferver to vacuum out the rest. I fell for it once and bought the extended version 6 months later. Never again. If they want my money, I will only give it to them once. My money has become very precious to me and I will make sure I spend it more wisely. Many Blu Ray players will take the DVD and up-convert the content to give it a better quality. I can live with that until the extended version is released. Put companies on notice. You want our business, then give us what we want, and not a poor substitute. I made sure to read which version was being released. I will not allow you to trick me again.",151

Every now and then, one page is blank, which shows the level of care which went into this edition. Mayhew deserves better treatment.",76
1,Brewing on ...,We had an older model for years of enjoyment as we drink coffee frequently throughout the day. Operation is similar to the previous model so there was no learning curve. Only difference is that the older model had a water level indicator we could see from the outside but this doesn't -- need to look in from the top to see where the water is. We did that once and then started using a measuring cup to fill with the right amount of water and then dump into the cofee maker versus stretching our necks over the top. Otherwise -- great product for the price.,105

0,Um ow.....,I bought this based on the good reviews...funny all the reviews dissapeard along with my first review. Let me say the sound quality is great I can hear everything on the other end. Sadly they can't hear me very well! Even though it comes with different sized ear parts none of them feel well after about 30 minutes of talking on the phone. You have to adjust it over and over. When you finally get it comfortable it the mic is up by your eyes. That would be great if I talked through my eyes but I don't. After 30 minutes the pain starts. It doesn't feel good at all. After an hour you might as well be getting your brain drilled into. I won't even get into what happens if you accidentally drop your phone while wearing this headset I doubt amazon will aprove the words...,147
0,Juiceman JM400 broken 4 times....,"We are big juicers. Our main home juicer is the Greenstar 2000. We got a Juiceman 400 as our travel juicer, but it has failed 4 separate times. Three were broken parts, and this last time the engine just quit!If you juice once a month, this might be OK, but if you really want a good juicer, that's not too expensive, we just replaced this JM400 with a CuisinArt 5 speed juicer. It's very quiet (whereas the JM400 sounds like a small jet aircraft).Don't try to run kale into your JM400. It's too weak and won't be able to juice it.Bottom line. The JM400 is just a toy.

0,Bad 80s? No Thanks,"Except for Zakk Starkey on drums, there is no reason to buy this album. The vocals are a bad Paul Rodgers copy and the songs are a cross between Mr. Mister and the Outfield, minus the commerical success. The late Mr. Entwistle should be comended for trying to form another group after the Who ""broke up,"" but this was really a stiffing of his personality for the sake of pop music that didn't go anywhere. The album really doesn't hold up well and there's only one song up to the standards of older Entwistle compositions. Hell, when I saw the Rock on tour in '87, they could barely make it through the set. Even John had enough and left the stage half way through the set. Buy another Entwistle album.",130
1,Goes down easy,"I am a person who hates to exercise. Having said this, I really, really like this tape. I like the fact that you can use the different intensity levels. At one point, I was doing the high intensity workout, and after I had recovered from surgery, I was doing the low one, and still getting a challenging workout. I also like the fact that the steps are very easy, as I don't like dancy tapes. I just want to sweat, not try out for the Rockettes. I also like the fact that Kathy is probably as unirritating as a fitness host is ever going to be. I say this because I find most hosts on these tapes to act and chirp like lobotomized cheerleaders and Kathy does not. She's more like a normal person who's helping you along.",138

I played it and it remended me of a RPG but you have more options to move around. The only thing I have a problems with this game is that in is full of mini-games. Mini-games that you MUST complete in order to move on in the game. But of course if you love the bitter irony of Luigi being the Mr.Green fraidy-cat then go on and by the game.

I bought 23 DVD's from the Columbia House which had 3 shows on their DVDs and were around $23.00 each! Most of the shows on the Columbia House volumes had episodes from the first 4 box sets recently released.One of the greatest shows ever and I'm at a loss as to these delays.

1,An insightful view into the life a brilliant journalist,"This unauthorized biography provided a rare view into the unusual life and career of one of the finest journalists of the 20th century. Oriana Fallaci has jealously guarded her own privacy, while making a career out of revealing often unflattering views of the movers and shakers of the 20th century. Oriana Fallaci's take her influence from her anti-fascist, intellectually idealistic upbringing. She worked tirelessly to break out of the limited existence most often reserved to a woman of her era. Her great political interviews and masterpieces like ""A Letter to a Child Never Born"" and ""Inshallah"" attest to her incisive, unconventional insight. I always wished to know more about her and now have had the opportunity.Santo Arico is to be congratulated for finally shedding light on the incredible life journey of the most influential female journalist of our time.",139

Thus, we only skimmed the parts of the book we considered were just a tepid introduction to Yourdon.If you already comfortable with task analysis, problem decomposition, and normalization, and simply want to know how to use this tool to develop a system, move on to something more practical, such as ""Rapid Application Development With Oracle Designer/2000"" by Chris Billings, et.al.",121

I wrapped the pwr cord around the rearview to prevent this while the approx 30min suction held. Buying replacements cups from Nuvi are non-existant.

But I am a light sleeper and these things kept me up all night. For one thing you can't roll around in them without getting tangled up. They have enough friction that they stick to your clothes when ever you shift positions. This drove me to distraction.Additionally, while I was awake trying to get myself untangled, I was constantly getting shocked. I can just imagine what my daughter, with her long blonde hair, would look like in the morning after sleeping in these.The material is thin and looks like it will wear out quickly, but I'm not really giving them the chance.

I think that the simulation was basically useless because there was entirely too much guesswork involved. There is no mention of what type of product is being manufactured, only that is made out of plastic. When making decisions such as how much to invest in product quality it would have helped quite a bit to know the specific type of product being produced. For example, quality is for more important when producing laptop computer cases than when producing toy army men. I think that the lack of specific information concerning the product and the market are the downfall of this book. The simulation would have been far more enjoyable and beneficial if informed decisions could be made.",132

1,Excellent Camcorder,"This is an excellent camcorder, it small, easy to carry around, and has good battery life. It even fits into a inexpensive carying case we had our for digital camera. It has a lot of great features and served us well on our vacation. Its been said before, but the only real drawback to this is the instructions. To Claridy: The camcorder can transfer still pics from its SD slot via a USB cable, you will need firewire to transfer it to the computer or use as a webcam - both which work very well. It also has all the necessary cables you will need if you just want to hook it up to your VHS/Home DVD burner via A/V cables and record, or just watch the playback on a TV. It could use an external audio mic output, but we found the internal microphone is quite sensitive and met our needs very well. Overall: Definately recomended",157

The main problem i had with the game is there was no purpose for your character. Sure you had quests but after you finsih them all whats next? wandering around killing people. Not my idea of fun.",97

0,Clippers that don't want to cut hair?!?,"When I bought these clippers July 2008, they worked fairly well for a few weeks for trimming my beard but then stopped cutting consistently. Since I live within a few miles of Sturtevant, I brought the clipper set to the Andis factory to see about getting them repaired. Instead they took my information and gave me a replacement on the spot.The replacement sounded different than the original, much quieter and slower-sounding, but still it was apparently the same model. It worked well as far as I knew, but recently I tried using it to trim the hair on my head. Beard hair, being far coarser, gets cut fairly easily, but cutting head hair using anything but the shortest attachments is virtually impossible. Using the one-inch comb, the clippers were more likely to push the hairs out of the way than to actually cut them!",144

0,"good for eight to ten year olds, but not avid modelists","I bought this model to expand upon my Superhero collection, which typically are vinyl high detail products. This model however was plastic, with uneven match points, and very poor detail. This model would be good for beginners, but for folks who try to take pride in the detail of thier work, this model is not for you. There is no amount of work you could do to make the model look any better than it does on the box, which appears to be the original sculpture it was molded after.",90
0,Lame,"If you're even reading this review that means you're probably considering buying this CD, well don't.

Actually I take that back even a retarded person wouldn't allow themselves to be subjected to listening to this crap. So why don't all you punk rock posers do us all a favor and go crawl under a rock with you're s***ty music because the rest of the world is sick of it.p.s.Ya mugentyper, it's not that it's cool to dislike Good Charlette, they just really suck, so why don't you shut the hell up cause nobody cares what canadians think about music, you f***ing tard.",142

That said, the filter arrived covered in white dust and I was suprised that they didn't include a cheap lens wipe in the package.",65

0,Missed opportunities.,"There are hundreds, perhaps thousands of sci-fi action novels that are good for an evening's entertainment. They read fast, the plot is shallow, and the characters wooden. You aren't disappointed because you didn't expect much.This pretty much describes Eagle Against the Stars. Yet, I was disappointed. White had a chance to take a major theme, the meeting of two cultures, one more advanced and do something interesting. Sort of a Science Fiction version of what happened to Japan when it met the west in the 19th century. I could see a fat book chuck full of details that could keep me busy for weeks.Unfortunately he took the easy way out and wrote a libertarian space opera complete with shallow characters, snide anti Liberal asides and predictable plot. As space opera, its worth reading. Yet, it coulda been a contender.J. A. Schroeder Seattle, WA",143
0,Bored to tears!,"While this book starts out in an interesting way it quickly becomes bogged down with boring, tedious, repetitive dialogue. The characters say the same things to each other over and over again. Nothing happens until almost 2/3 of the way into the book. Even then, it is very slow moving and somewhat predictable. I have never read anything else by this author and I probably won't after this. My advice: pass on this one and read something else, maybe something by Jo Beverly or Heather Cullman (just for examples).",89
1,My favorite kitchen tool,"I've had one of these for years and I use it so much I'm surprised it's still working. I've had food processors since they came on the market and this one has lasted the longest, and it gets used here. When I bought this thing I had no idea I'd have it more than a year or two, because I really use a processor; but, I'm thinking this one has lasted at least five years. I am a from scratch cooker and it's used all the time and I've even given it as wedding presents. Sauce prep is a snap, but my favorite is the way it handles bread. It was the first processor I had that let me mix a standard big loaf without having to knead in half the remaining dough, and it's fast. The only reason I'm looking to buy another now is this one came up under sale items and my bowl is not as pretty as it once was and it would be nice to have a back up just in case it broke. Plus, they make good wedding gifts.",185

The ACT principles are communicated intelligently and clearly in this book.",76

0,Disturbing for little ones,"I'll just get right to it. One of the puppies is run over and killed by a tractor. My four year old ran up to his room crying when this happened and my 8 year old sat on the couch stunned with watery eyes. It really ticks me off when kid's movies do this. It is so unnecessary. My kids already have parents and we do a pretty good job teaching and preparing our kids for life. When I pop a movie in and offer them some popcorn, it is for one reason only; to provide entertainment and pleasure. It is not so some stranger can attempt to teach them lessons on death and loss. Really inappropriate and unnecessary. I am suprised no other review has mentioned this...Like other reviews point out, the kids were very obnoxious. They are horribly behaved and at one point, one of them even yells at an adult and call him names (the adult was a likeable character, not even a bad guy)in front of their parents, who do nothing about it. Awful movie.",179

While some discrepancies between Reese and the evidence in the murders he committed nags at Hobbes, a riddle Reese asked him shortly before the execution turns up the suicide of a polieman thirty years ago and entangles Hobbes in the web that binds these two cases together with thousands of years of history and the supernatural.Yeah, it's a great premise. Too bad it's given such short shrift in here. Every aspect of this film was done better in Seven, despite the difference in their mechanations (the killer in Fallen really IS supernatural), and held up against its predecessor, Fallen leaves a whole lot to be desired.",147

0,I question Christopher Hitchens credibility,"I used to work for Gift of Love, Mother Teresa's Aids Hospice in San Francisco. What Christopher Hitchens reports about the hospice is completely untrue. We administered pain medication on demand. Our hospice was highly recommended by UCSF's Aids clinic and all of the AIDS organization in SF. We had a long waiting list of AIDS patients trying to get in. Public Health Nurses would work on a daily basis at the hospice and were highly supportive of its operation. In this one area, Christopher Hitchens seems to have purposefully sought out people who would support his side of the story. Such deterministic reporting makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of his book. The title reflects his bias. Hilary Kotter",123

It is poorly acted, poorly written, and it's has a few scenes that the direction would make a high school drama club cringe. In addition the movie has vaguely Christian themes, but no substance. The only real enjoyment I got out of this was heckling it with my friends. There is a review on the cover that says it is the best western since ""Tombstone""; That is a bold face lie. In addition it says that it has Daniel Baldwin on the cover. Now I'm not a Baldwin fan but it is always a sign of a bad movie when they list the biggest actor on the cover and he has maybe 5 lines and about 30 seconds on screen.",139

The TR5 engine will have be brought back to save the Tomb Raider series, and it will be difficult to get back the people who have written it off.

If not for the Otter Box and my desire to be able to swim with it, I would choose something else. For the same money one can buy one from Creative. The Creative one has a display, uses standard AAA batteries, allows one to play music by album,skip albums or just find a particular song or album, which without a display the Shuffle is incapable of doing. The switch on the back does not have a good detent to allow choosing between shuffle and sequential play. If you only want to hear music in random order, do not desire to see what is playing, have to use one internal battery which needs a USB cord or special charger to charge, buy the Shuffle.

He sells out Catholic Church teachings about exorcism by making trivial and shallow assertions about it all. The church doesnt revolve around a guy who didnt make his hash marks as a writer with his one effort... it was the film maker who put the fantasy of 'exorcist' into pop culture, and the film is different than the book and shows true genius in film making. Regarding Blatty's writings trivializing exorcism, his book cant be put ahead of the real Christ that the real Church revolves around solely. In that way, the Exorcist book is uninformed and inaccurate in its ""facts"" about exorcism. The book is entertainment, but not in any way a serious portrayal of what is.",150

Unfortunately it's there, though, and the iPod lock switch does NOT override it. So you cannot keep it assembled and at the ready because it's forever turning itself on and draining the battery, recording hours of unwanted background noise.

Those unforgettable B+W images of a time only 30 years gone made a massive impact on me back then.So naturally I wondered if re-watching this series again now might show it all to be badly dated in the post-MTV age. I couldn't have been more wrong. Just seeing the combination of those haunting opening credits along with Olivier's haunting human narration and Carl Davis's moving score all over again felt like a punch in the stomach. In these dark violent times, this wonderful humanitarian series chronicling possibly the only worthy war in mankind's history hasn't dated a bit. Indispensable stuff.",128

I can only assume they lost the Master Negative and just used an existing print for the DVD and that print had damage at some point and was missing the line....Totally incredible-the one line that makes the movie, makes the ending and it is missing. Like an idiot I threw away my VHS copy before watching the DVD..",134

0,Printer Drops the Ball,"I pre-ordered this book as its topic was of great interest to me professionally.

Even with the missing material this is a very short book at only 138 pages (without the end matter and notes) in a small format of 8"" x 5"". My negative review is not a reflection on the author and the quality of his research and writing, but instead on the printer who made such a glaring error that went to market unnoticed. I still look forward to reading this book, but will want to lay my hands on a copy to make sure its complete before buying it.",123

0,Good points but not for everyone,"A great read. Very thought provoking. However, I was taught from a very young age that you never, ever casually open someone else's refrigerator and take food without asking. It doesn't matter if its the refrigerator of close family or your best friend. It's bad manners and very disrespectful. So the idea of ""Refrigerator Rights"" doesn't resonate with me AT ALL. Though the points in this book make sense in today's world, not everyone enjoys being around a lot of people and that doesn't mean such people are ""limited"" in how much enjoyment they get out of life. I took exception to the author's apparent belief that self-reliance is bad. You can't always lean on others.",116

1,molto buono!!!,"If you have ever been to Italy, if you are Italian (100% or 8%), if you've ever known anybody Italian or eaten Italian food, this tome will shed light & help make sense of this beautiful country and her idiosyncratic inhabitants. A first edition paperback graced my grandparent's bookshelf since as far back as I can remember (30+ years). I took it home after my grandma (an Italian immigrant) passed away at the age of 97. I haven't been able to put it down since. If you're Italian, this book just verbalizes what you've known or at least suspected your whole life. If your not Italian, then you will probably say to yourself many times over, ""that explains a lot!""Happy reading!Viva Italia!",122
1,Fun workout,You get actually 3 workouts on this DVD. the first one is 1-1/2 hour but actually has a break after the first 60 minutes so you can quit then or keep going or just do the last 1/2 hour and then there a separate 30 minute fat burning workout as well. I sometimes do the entire 90 minute but sometimes I break them up. The 30 minute fat burning workout is good too. They must have the workout rooms temperature turned way up because I barely break out in a sweat with the 30 minute workouts on Taebo and everyone on the video is soaking wet.,106

Charles Schneer and Ray Harryhausen were a incomprable team and anyone would be proud to own every movie they did together you will not find high adventure on such a wholesome level as the movies done by Ray Harryhausen and Charles Schneer they bring your child great adventure without a over saturation of violence, sex & the ever popular f-bomb these are movies that truely deliever because they are strong on story line and short on smut and as far as i'm conscerned the special effects still stand up well today often lending a sort of surealism that enhances the movie.

0,Yawn...,"Rather than attempt to develop a plot, after delivering the initial hooks of characterization, Winterson proceeds to muddle around in their depressingly disorganized perspectives of modern life. The characters' only hope, it seems, is somehow finding a way to express themselves in their dire conditions, all of which have something to do with sex. If there were some way of expressing how contrived the bleakness of the world and the situations they encounter, how flat and boring the characters are, and how ""random"" the thought and phrase juxtapositions are... Well. I would. Alas, the only real way to experience this psychobabble is to pick it up for yourself. If you're miserable and looking for company, or a college student who has to read this for class, :kaff: pick it up.",130

I got tired of the protagonist wallowing in all her cliched 40 something feelings of despair and emptiness. Erotic? I don't think so. It was like reading Danielle Steele at her shmaltziest.I was irritated that the protagonist's plain old honest to goodness lack of maturity was portrayed as soul searching, and that a suicide would be viewed as anything other than a coward's way out. Because I like to believe that there are some elimental truths about life and spirituality, this story completely rubbed me the wrong way. All the main characters were victimized by one thing or another and I would have liked to see at least one of them realize that, as an adult, being a victim is a choice.",140

Two songs from the CD, ""Away"" and ""Forward in Time"" are fimilar songs to her fans, having played them live prior to this release. What I find unique about those songs are how subtle changes were made on the CD and it was like finding a forgotten Christmas gift while taking down the tree. What fun ! Check out her gutsy performance on ""Love Don't Come Around"" as well as ""Somebody's Daughter"". In fact the entire CD is full of great vocals, songwriting, a great band and guest musicians. Jennie, you rock ! They do say that it's impossible to wear out CD's...right ?",124

1,"""War is a nasty business""","This excellent mini-series tells the story of RAF Hornet Squadron, from their frustration during the ""Phony War"" to the deadly air combat over England. This movie succeeds where the 1969 movie ""Battle of Britain"" failed. Don't get me wrong, I like ""Battle of Britain"", but the characters in this are developed so that you get to know each one (although they die off rather quickly). As the war progresses, some of the pilots go nuts, some become hard-hearted, and others simply go numb and follow orders blindly. My favorite character is the cynical ""Moggy"" (played by Neil Dudgeon), who always has a negative sarcastic comment to say! There's enough humor, romance, and especially action to keep anyone entertained from beginning to end. The airiel photography is awesome and really captures the beauty of the Spitfire, one of the finest fighter planes of all time. This movie is highly recommended.",149

You are missing this item and then that item,then your Activation key doesn't show up in their database even when I have been having service for the last 4 months and getting billing emails from them. Got the TIVO rebate in 6 weeks. Finally sent the last letter to them with a copy of my monthly bill, telling them if they can't get it right I will probably cancel service soon and get a Tivo. A week later they billed me for the next month and 2 days after that( a week after the warranty was done) my RePlay died, the AV plugs ins will not take a Video signal in.

The two actors play back and forth with pranks and hilarious lines. This is a classic western comedy! Anyone who likes John Wayne films will love it. The ending is so good I cannot spoil it for you now. Every home should add this copy to it's westerns. My favorite thing about the movie is that while Kirk Douglas thinks he is sly, the Warden proves to be even more cunning. Just another story to prove, ""Crime doesn't Pay""",103

The 29 Soviet Mechanized Corps on the border were a shambles. Readiness was below 40% in most and training was a disaster. This alone refutes the premise of icebreaker. David Glantz, the greatest Soviet military historian, flatly refutes icebreaker in his book, 'Stumbling Colossus'.

It lasted EXACTLY 6 months before freezing up on me. No amount of tech support would bring it back to life. I said, well, I guess i will just spend the extra cash and get an ipod.The low price of the Nomad 30GB seduced me. I picked one up instead of the pod, and I loved it, for about 6 months. Then the headphone jack stopped working. Luckily, this time I got the service plan, so when my refund check arrives, I am off to buy... an Ipod.",116

0,a missed opportuntiy,"I have read all of Julie Garwood's books and looked forward to seeing one of them come to life. Sadly this was not to be. The highly forgetable actress who played Rose was overly pouty and did not resemble the strong and capable character of the book. While the cinematography was beautiful, the film was void of the depth of character of the novel. It seemed as though the scriptwriter could not allow Adam, the african-american Claymore to be as vital to the film as he was in the book. The ending, which included a senseless betrayal, the death of Cole and Rose settling for Fergus(none of which were in the book) was a tv movie whimp out. Perhaps, if it had been four hour film presentation there would have been time enough to tell the story in a way that truly honored Julie Garwood's wonderful work. Ditch the moive and READ THE BOOKS, as each brother had there own story.",161

0,Half-baked theory,"The book's extensive documentation of homosexuality in animals may be valuable, but the book's style doesn't leave me with much confidence that its interpretations of the research are sufficiently unbiased to be relied upon.The book's discussions of why it is hard to provide an evolutionary explanation of homosexuality are mostly reasonable, but the alternative to evolution that the book proposes isn't sufficiently well thought out to qualify as a testable scientific hypothesis. Evolutionary theory has a good enough track record at explaining things that appear at first glance to be counterproductive that people shouldn't reject it without finding an alternative with a good deal of explanatory power. But exuberance is an idea which explains very little. And anyone who has made impartial observations of typical natural ecosystems should see that the extravagance and waste that the book worships are sufficiently uncommon as to be hard to reconcile with the book's characterization.",151
0,American Pie,"The success of this movie leave one wondering...It does show that it does not take a lot to entertain people. The story is about a bunch of teenagers wanting to get laid, and their embarrasing experiences. The movie is very vulgar and relies completely on vulgar humor to get by. The movie DOES have a point but it is sadly lost among the gimmicks and jokes. The movie is highly overrated, I think. I will say only giggling teenagers can find this funny(or people with an incredible juvenile sense of humor). If you think a guy having sex with a pie, a guy drinking a beer that includes manly fluids is funny then this is definately for you.",118

He answers a few questions from the previous books and makes the fantasy world a bit more complete.i really enjoyed this one and recommend it to everyone. The part about the Valinor who are the next step from kings is interesting. One war was because the mortal men couldn't go to the deathless island of the elves or the valinor's island.So the men were pretty much on Saurons side the whole time and the Elves and dwarves on the other.The book is very creative and therearen't so many journeys",119
0,Same Old Story,"Comparing the 2011 ""prequel"" to the 1982 original is like a masterclass in the difference between modern Hollywood and even the Hollywood of just a few decades ago.The Thing (1982) was a gory horror/sci-fi film aimed mostly at teens and nerds (or both, like me) but it has great performances, edgy dialogue, and truly frightening and disturbing scenes.The Thing (2011) has interchangeable characters who might as well not even have names, by-the-book CGI, no atmosphere, and no suspense. It barely even has the jump-scares that normally Hollywood can be expected to deliver.In 1982, Kurt Russell scraped hot wires in petri dishes of blood to divine who was a monster and who wasn't.In 2011, Flavor of the Month Actress #7209 shone a flashlight into the other characters' mouths to see if they had fillings to divine who was a monster and who wasn't.'Nuff said.",143

1,"Bluegrass, But More...","This is one of my favorite albums of all time... I have it on vinyl and CD. The vocals are haunting and beautiful... Check out the title track. This album is bluegrass... but more. It achieves the near impossible task of allowing in non-traditional bluegrass instruments like piano, pedal steel and percussion without losing the focus on harmony and string driven music. I believe it is a must listen for fans of bluegrass and acoustic music... and did I mention the vocals... Oh BTW, I think this version of Edward's ""Sunshine"" is the definitive ""Sunshine.",95

I thought this book would be a perfect gag gift that's actually somewhat useful. I was torn between buying this or ""Everybody Poops"" but thought this was more appropriate.The book is hilarious and definitely something a preschooler or kindergartner could read with their parents. There is some innocent drawn nudity (boy bathing with his dad) so if you're wary about that, I'd suggest buying something else. But honestly, it's like a kid's drawing and you could tell it's not intended to offend. Just a forewarning for those worried about things like that.",104
1,Very comprehensive but technical,"The book is very comprehensive going into a lot of detail and at times is very technical. There are lots of tables and statistics. However, it does a great job of explaining how the various aspects of the game impact the outcome of each shot. Things like cue ball and object ball movement, best cue stick positions for type of shot, how english and top and bottom spin impact cue ball placement, and much more. If you focus on the less technical aspects taught in this book you will come out with a much better understanding of how to shoot better pool. I'm still reading it but have learned alot and I consider myself a better than average pool player already. It is at times tough reading but you can get into it as deeply as you desire and several readings over time will glean more information.",147

With each new release I see this once acclaimed producer falling into a deeper and deeper hole. You want good Irene CD's refer back to the Club series mixes and the Hard House Diva ones as well. Don't agree with me, spend two months in the scene and you will see why Irene is simply the record labels new project.",128
0,Unrealistic Revaltion,"When Lori was first developing and going through her eating disorder it seemed extremely true to life. I myself have an eating disorder and I could relate to her denial and the control that EDs can have on your mind. However, although it happened to her, the way that she understands and changes her eating disorder is COMPLETELY out of the ordinary. I don't think I would recommend this book to an ED victim because I think that they would be waiting to see their ""skinny self"" in the mirror. For most ED patients, this never happens. Even after they get the ED under control they will never see themselves as this. Through treatment you learn to accept yourself regardless of how you look, but that never changes how it looks in the mirror. Lori was very lucky to be able to see the destruction she was doing to herself, but for most people, they will never see that image in the mirror. God Bless.",165

These speakers worked great right out of the box and I am pleased with them. They were the perfect solution to my challenge. I especially like the ability to increase or decrease the volume right on the speaker - in my application - right on the bedside stands. The only reason I didn't rate this product 5 stars was the fact that I have to turn them off when not in use, or I get a little hum and an occasionl crackle from them. That is not what your need in the middle of the night at the bedside. I assume it is from some electrical interference, but I prefer not to have to turn them on everytime I use them. Other than that, they worked great for me.",164

The most jarring thing is the psuedo-60s overlays with the guest's names after Carson announces them. What's the matter, can't we hear?Oh well.

ANYBODY could do that. Is it really excruciatingly painful to write your own song, instead of ripping off everybody elses music and sticking your own crap on top? Or how about forming a coherent sentence? The yeahs, whats and okays get old very fast.

Must read for anyone going into the wilds even for a short day hike. I would recommend it to anyone. Information is centered on how to stay safe and alive for short periods of time. (The time it would take for a search and rescue operation to find you) Included are very valuable ideas to help rescuers find you faster. It does not go into long term primitive living skills such as food collection or how to build log cabins. It does give you all you need to know before going anywhere that has potential for getting lost or stranded and be able to get back out alive.,135

My fingers are literally bleeding from trying to pry the legs off after I put them in the incorrect holes. If anyone can tell me of an easy way to do this, I'd much appreciate it. So you'll find the claim that this is easy to install to be incorrect as soon as you attempt step one which is to snap the legs on.",110
1,Unsettling but an intriguing book,I try to read as much about history as possible. People who are fighting or have fought in wars are our loved ones and ancestors. This book is not pretty - but it is not meant to be. It is a book based on one man's journey in life and Auschwitz. I would recommend it to anyone. We need to know the history of our land and people.,68

This album does not sound like a debut album it is very well produced.The album keeps coming at you with beautiful song after beautiful song.

Immediately out of the box it was hissing and clicking when I put a CD in. I tried multiple CD's (both RW's and standard) and found no change in the clicking noise. This unit was purchased to play quiet music in an work office and the clicking certainly overwhelms the music at lower volumes. After reading the reviews here, I discovered that I am not the only one with this problem. Given the number of people that have mentioned this problem I would reccomend against purchasing this product.",105

You roll over the bump with one tire and you are parked just in the right place. I love it.",71

In fact, it gives the name and models of the products it is made for, but it DOES NOT list the Aleratec model. The pads on the kit are very thin and look as if they have already lived their serviceable life. It also has a piece with a clear, square base, that does not come with the disk repair kit, and NO explanation or instructions on what it is or how it is used. Cheap price, CHEAP kit!

It is a bit cumbersome to get the shelves to into the cage and to stay latched to the cage. The sides of the cage hook together but are not very secure. Our ferret pushed through the sides of the cage where the sides did not stay hooked together. We were not home and so she was squeezed by the metal as she got only 1/2 way through. Therefore, she died. I would not recommend this cage due to the poor construction and safety implications.",106

1,Be sure to do your homework when reading reviews,"This is a fine Latin text for the mature or adult student who is able and willing to learn and to study Latin as more than a hobby. I must add for the consumer's sake that a previous review is very misleading. ""Bennett's New Latin Grammar,"" suggested as an alternative, is not a textbook, but a reference grammar best suited for beginning to intermediate Latin students (more advanced grammars being ""Allen & Greenough"" and ""Hale & Buck""). Wheelock is a fine alternative to ""Latin: An Intensive Course,"" and is somewhat easier to follow, but either book will suit a mature individual. I highly recommend using in addition a good mid-level dictionary (Chambers-Murray being the best for size, scope, and price) as well as a good beginning reference grammar (Bennett being the most readily available, and probably the easiest to use--but you'll want to upgrade later).",145

Celine does a great job with her version which is aimed at the dance floors. Her voice sounds great and the song rocks.But once again, this proves in the inferiority of remakes. Beat for beat, vocal for vocal, Cyndi Lauper's version blows Celine's out of the atmosphere. Whereas Celine's is guided toward the club, Cyndi's version is haunting. Cyndi sings this song from the heart and captures the longing and desperation in her vocals. Buy both if you can (they're both good) but if you had to choose one or the other, buy Cyndi's.",119

They really aren't that loud to begin with, but when you lay down say for bench, the back part pushes against your neck, and then the ear buds pop out.

On #21 of section 4, the answer given on page 65 is 1/16. When explained, the answer given is 1/16-1/32=1/16 This is the the same as saying 2-1=1. Well, I just wanted to point that out.

The characters such as the Scarecrow, Tin Man, the Lion, Tik Tok, Jack, and Gump look more like they should from the covers of the original books(not people in make-up and colorful clothes). If you are thinking of getting this and have silly ideas of it being like the classic musical DON'T! It's much different, but in my mind better. Tik Tok is my favorite character and he looks and sounds so cool. Hope this helps anyone interested in this movie. Being from Kansas i should know right? -LOL",110

I was fully prepared for the badness of the movie, friends had told me, ""It's bad, but Jet Li is really cool.""Strangely enough, I was still surprised at how awful the movie was. The reason that I call this movie action pornography is because every scene is contrived to show action. There's almost no pretence at a real plot, it's just action scene after action scene with some veneer of story written in as an aside. That sounds like pornography to me with action subsctituted for sex.All of the jokes have been done before, even in the last few Lethal Weapons movies. They're funny but I heard that in the last movie.If you liked this movie, you might want to take a look at Armageddon, it's about in the same quality category.",167

Many witnesses were present with my friend when it happened. This, already, is a bad sign.I visited the website myself to read some excerpts of the book. The writing doesn't feel like Morrison. It doesn't have this sparkle you see in his poems, and believe me, I have ALL of Morrison's writings.

1,"Fine Turner performance, mediocre movie.","Melodrama may not be Tracy's cup of tea, but it's definitely Lana's. This film showcases Turner at the peak of her career at MGM. Lingering closeups fill the screen with her luminous beauty. Her character in this film is an outsider who rebels against the strictures of small-town life. Tracy plays her much older husband and the two have a delightful and unexpected screen chemistry. Several scenes demonstrate what made Turner one of MGM's top box office draws--her delight as she models some new clothes in a swank New York shop, a tender scene with Tracy after she is seriously injured in a traffic accident, and her heart-rendering portrayal of grief when she learns that her much-anticipated baby is stillborn. It's a lovely performance from Turner, very fresh and natural and quite different from the cold, reserved characterizations of her later films. An essential purchase for Turner fans.",148

The 4 year old can use it with little difficulty, so u sure can.*****/*****",109

0,Same problem here - doesn't hold a charge,"I experienced the same problem as the other reviewer - the unit didn't hold a charge even after 72+ hours of charging. Ordered a replacement unit within a week and couldn't believe it, but also this one had the problem and I needed to return again !",47

0,Horrible message,"I bought this book because I was hoping for a sex positive book for females. I was definitely wrong. Tons of the short stories were of women being taken advantage of. For example, take Goldy Locks and the Three Bears. Instead of bears it was three men. When they found Goldy Locks in their house they surrounded her and started taking off her clothes. It sounded more like rape than sexy to me. Every story the female didn't like what was happening, but then suddenly she was fine with it.To me this was not a female positive book at all. It was just suggesting the idea that women like being raped.",111
0,Disappointed,"I ordered three of the 9100's the first week of June, 2008. I was surprised that one of the units had completely stopped working by the second week of July and then a week later a second unit failed. Replacing the batteries did not help with either of the failed units so I will be returning all three units for a refund. The refund will only be a partial refund since it has been over 30 days since I made the purchase.",82
0,Convoluted tripe,"The director Nicholas Evans, sought a venue for his latest cyber-nanotechnological theory. Sadly unlike the Coen brothers, it wasn't rooted in solid physical concrete production design nor did it consider the viewers, innocent babes, seeing it for the first time. I'm a screenplay writer, with one optioned project, have watched movies non stop since age 9 with family and friends, lived and worked in NYC as a professional writer, but don't know how this got produced, unless Knob Leonardo deCaprio fronted most of the geld. Oh, whoops! Look at those credits! Here, let's throw in some car chase sequences, stern visaged close ups, home theme,,,,awwww.....guns......terse vacuous dialogue.....zippo emotional content because it is, Leonardo....sans the heart of a real lion. Save your money and go to the zoo.",127
1,Wonderful Product!,"Finally, a cheese slicer that works without wires! While visiting my parents this summer, I asked to use a cheese slicer for a dish I was preparing, and Dad produced a this slicer that blew me away.

1,Great camera! Loved it,"I've decided to jump from a Compact Digital Camera to SLR,and a thou I've seem quite a few reviews on this camera on the net,but I was quite stounded with with the size of the camera,especially the size the lens.The build-in Anti-Shake sensor is really useful compare to some other SLRs (about the same class). The noise reduction is quite good.But still there's some downsides as well, as said in the review from websites. The live view is useful.(Like when you've to put the camera over your head or very low, etc)But there's a quite long delay when its doing the focusing job.And the people who wears glasses may find it quite hard to see in the viewfinder, may need to buy ME-1.Anyway..since there's a lots of opinions, I won't comment too much.but I would say its a great camera, and I'm loving it! =D(Sorry for the poor English.)",149
0,Careful,"If I had time I would send this back. Appears to only work with power connections that are on the same breaker. I have a small house (1600 sq.ft), and are unable to have the Master/Slave see each other unless they are on the same breaker. It is either run a cable or get good wireless, waste of $$ and time at least for me.",65
0,Another Death in the Industrial Era. R.I.P. S.P.,This was a real shocker when i got the cd about three weeks ago thank to a online buddy. But I really tried to give the album a chance only daddyuwarbash whatever song that was decent but the rest sorry. They had almost 10 years to write stuff and it comes down to this. A Shame. But with this album I say this should be the final straw and hang up the synths and Vocador and call it the final nail in the coffin. The songs were too over here and over there it was not like the dark elements and the dark vocals and harsh lyrics just a sold out industrial band. Thank You SYNTHSPOP for making this all possible. I will stick to my New Wave Bands and CDS. Industrial is dead!,134

0,Eegad!,"With such a promising beginning and a story that could easily have written itself, one has to ask...How could you blow it in such a big way. I sat in horror indeed, grasping my head firmly in my hands, rocking back and forth violently crying, ""Why did he ever get out of the truck and show himself?"" So many great ideas crashed through my head during the first part of the movie as to what our friendly neighborhood killer could be, and what he was attempting to accomplish. I more than once found myself muttering repeatedly ""What the Hell!"". In short, this movie found new ways to violate me...don't let it happen to you.",114

1,Pretty Good Pump,"I don't really have anything to go by, but I think this pump is great. Once you get the hang of it, it doesn't hurt, it does a thorough job and it was a decent price. The only problem I have with it is that the arms sometimes move while I am pumping and I lose suction because the cup gets moved. The manufacturer should of had a locking mechanism for them. Otherwise it's a lot faster than doing it by hand!! That's for sure!I would buy this product again if I had to!",94
0,Only if your an only child,I bought this game for my niece and nephew who are about seven years of age. I don't know how to put the game on multi player and it says it plays up to four players. it's not so easy to understand. My niece likes it. My nephew believes it's a game and it's great. It's got trivia and all that. Just don't want to play it. I am 28. So...buy if your a gamer.,75

All my friends rave about how funny he is, yet I find his material boring, unfunny, and full of annoying/stupid sound effects. I also can't take how he carries jokes out WAY too long. My wife finds this crap hilarious yet she can't explain why. Maybe Dane is like that guy in highschool that all the girls thought was so funny and yet all the guys hated his guts?With so many talented, original and funny comedy CD's (mitch hedberg, david cross, mike birbiglia, todd barry, patton oswalt, etc.) I can't imagine why you'd waste your money on this CD.",108

It cuts out a lot of the time, the caller ID function has a lot of quirks compared to other phones I have used. The phone also sounds ""tinny"" a lot of the time. Everyone who comes over and uses it, comments on its bad sound quality. I would NOT recomend. WE are currently searching for a new one.",83
0,Odd history,This is a pretty book and no doubt i contains much of value. However the article on the history of Finland is fundamentally flawed and quite misleading. For example it claims that language conflicts have been a central issue in the history of Finland. That is has little to do with reality. The article is so odd it makes you wonder what sources have been used. It also makes the whole book seem quite unrealiable. It's a shame because the book is nice enough otherwise and could probably fill a gap in many a book shelves.,96
1,Runaway Smash Hit!,Brilliant work from Julia Roberts and Richard Gear. It's about time you guys got together again to film this movie. The movie flows very well from one scene to the next.

0,AWFUL!,"I recall seeing ""Caligula"" when it first came out. And for all the controversy it caused, it is nothing more than an expensive porn film. But aside from that, it is appallingly bad....boring, tedious, shocking for it's own sake and just plain stupid. The violence is gratutious and the sex is added to try and shock mainstream audiences. An abomination.",60
1,Contrary to Popular Opinion.....,"The drive is great. Access speed are limited to your ethernet speed so access speed can be an issue for speed demons out there. However, contrary to popular belief, you do not need to install any software. Microsoft's built-in network manager can find the drive easily on the same network. If you want the drive for use outside your private network then you WILL need the software. Otherwise, there are a lot of sour grapes out there that do not know how to find a network drive. Word to the wise, the first time we put the drive on the network we had to turn the power off and turn it back on since it didn't get assigned an IP address on the router. So this method may be the trick you need to SEE it on the network. Enjoy a great home solution to networking.",146

0,Cruiser1,"I have had this griddle for about 1 1/2 yrs. I agree with most others. One side heats better than the other. After first few uses items stopped sticking. I did like it for creating the filling for breakfast burritoes, you know hashbrown potatoes,sausage,bacon,eggs and cheese wrapped in tortillas. But now everything sticks it has heat marks from where the element is and the teflon has worn off. I bought this when it first came out and only paid $20 for it so I guess I got my moneys worth. But when you have 4 children waiting on their pancakes you can't have some cooked others stuck and falling apart. I am currently looking for a new griddle hope I find one worthy enough to stand up to the demands that I put on my cookware.",136

1,Great reading,"The third book of Henning Mankell and his inspector Wallander. And again it is a great book to read. This time Wallander is confronted with a women who is shot without any apparent motive. From the beginning the reader knows what is going on: she was at the wrong time at the wrong place. The assassination of Nelson Mandela is prepared in Sweden and the woman has seen things that she was not supposed to see. Only after a long and complicated investigation Wallander and his colleagues can unravel all the ties and go after the villain, the ex-KGB man Konovalenko.From the beginning the reader knows both sides of the story and sees the events through the eyes of all actors, but this book is still very exciting with numerous unexpected turns. There are a few chapers which are a bit boring, that is why I give this book 4 rather than 5 stars.",154

0,Extremely disappointing,"This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review. I am not overly-knowledgeable about the ""Concordians,"" but am reasonably literate. I'm much more familiar with the London Bloomsburians, and love literary biography. I am not qualified to speak to the alleged plethora of inaccuracies in the book, but even without that, it's a very disappointing book. Yes, it's readable and somewhat entertaining, but I'm learning very little about the thought and inner lives of the Transcendentalists. The book also moves confusingly between what would charitably be called analysis, and chronology. I suppose this is a fault of editing, but it makes the book less coherent. The only positive to having bought this is that I now plan to read some of the good books recommended by other disappointed reviewers.",132

0,error filled,"I was one of the people interviewed for this book and am quoted several times throughout. It's a slip shod effort by Shipnuck that is filled with factual errors, misspelled words and names and typos. The author is desparately trying to be funny and along the way he stretches the truth. Beem's win at the 1999 Kemper Open and how he got there is a great story. Unfortunately, Shipnuck shouldn't have been the one to tell it.",77
1,What do you call 12 great Nick Gilder tunes on one CD?,"A GOOD START!Back when Razor & Tie had just released the first of Donnie Iris' LP's, their web site asked visitors for suggestions on what artists they would like to see released. I immediately emailed them saying they HAD to release albums by Nick Gilder and City Boy (i'm still waiting for City Boy).Well, it took a long time, but this CD is GREATLY appreciated. Nick Gilder was a standout rocker with a unique sound. If Nick is crankin' out of your system, you aren't going to mistake him for anybody else..About the CD...Nice remastering. The songs sound crisp and clear. A decent selection of songs, but as other reviewers have noted, some glaring ommissions. Some of my favorites that are NOT on the CD: Metro Jets (how did this one get away???)We'll Work It Out (Hello??) Time After Time (McFly...Anybody Home?) Hold On Me Tonight. Well, the list could go on.",152

I am now trying to get it fixed but can't get a repair scheduled within two weeks at the earliest. I am very unimpressed.",77

The filter is built from durable plastic and a wire mesh screen. I've used this product for over a year now a few times per month and it's help up fine. I even wash it in the dishwasher. This would have got 5 stars, but the filter holder is sometimes difficult to pop in and out of the Keurig machine.The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

I usually dont have a problem with swearing, but the way this band did it ruined the cd. It seemed like every other word in the songs are F$%*. It sounded like they tried to damn hard to impress the youth by doing this. The cd held nothing speical at all, not what I really wanted to hear in a metal cd. If you want really inspiring music go and listen to a Hatebreed cd. This cd is alright, but the swearing was so stupid and out of place. HA! Thats what I meant to say, the swearing just seemed random and out of place. Thats what the problem with the cd was. Just add it here and there, not every other word. Probably would have been a better cd that way. To fans fo Throwdown, please do complain. Everyone has an opinion and that is mine.",178

0,Doesn't live up to its namesake,"I picked this book up with no knowledge about it; I just saw everyone reading it. I found it horrible; I had to make myself finish it.Basically, the leaps of logic made in the book are far out and unrealistic. I found the book to also be very anti-Catholic, and, being a Catholic, I found much of the text to be offensive and inaccurate. Anyone with a basic knowledge of Christian and Catholic history can punch holes through the plot so large that it becomes worthless to continue reading.This is not an accurate book or a historical expose as many believe it to be; it is at best a poor fictional story. My only regret is that many people pick up the book and read it, believing, as the author represents it to be, as a storyline imposed on a factual basis.",142

Now I have to return and wait who knows how long for a replacement and keep my fingers crossed that all 3 discs are in the package when the new one arrives. I'll continue to order the seasons as they are released but I won't preorder any more and will wait for the lower price. Overall I love NX and am happy to have my own copies of this beloved show, but each season has been a bit of a let down with the packaging issues, music and less than stellar way the discs are marked.

The events are about as unrealistic as you can get. Don't get me wrong. The idea of a kid with flying shoes is fine with me, but the writing and direction made it seem like this was done by a couple of 10 year old kids. After destruction of private property, vandalism, and assault, nobody calls the police, only 911 to have the aunt taken to the hospital. This movie had the potential on so many levels to be so much better. Save your money and your time. Skip this one.",114

So, I came to the conclusion that it doesn't suck, which sucks! I'm done with Hoover. They should recall this piece of sh@t for the inconvenience it causes.",87

1,Get Ready to Ship Out...,"Nothing can completely prepare you for the experience of basic training... but this book does contain some useful material. If you're completely clueless, this book can point you in the right direction. The most important part of being prepared for basic training is being in the best physical shape of your life before you join, of course, even if you're not, you will be able to pass the PT test by the end of basic. I can't remember exactly where the writer went to Basic Training, but every TRADOC post is a bit different, I went to Fort Knox, and it was the most hardcore experience of my life... it was crazy, and nothing can prepare you for the experience. At least this book might give you a little bit of confidence before you ship out.",136

1,Strong Characters Make This A Winner,"Homicide detective, Tom McMichael is charged with investigating the brutal murder of 84 year old Pete Braga. Complicating the case is the fact that the McMichael and Braga families have a long standing feud, that includes violence on both sides. Parker does a wonderful job of introducing his characters to the reader without a lot of tedious details. I've read many of Parker's previous novels and it's his writing style that keeps me coming back. He tells a good story and keeps the pace moving at a good clip. His characters stay with me long after I've finished a book of his. I can still remember Silent Joe...one of my favorites. Tom McMichael will stay with me too. A decent guy trying to do a good job under difficult circumstances. A very enjoyable read.",134
0,Almost a Great Product but Ruined by Bratty Character,"I find it very disappointing that the creators of this product don't realize that an unspeakably bratty animated character ruins this product. The Jumpstart team is so loaded with technical talent and teaching savvy, but apparently they don't think that social skills matter, since the whole product is centered around a loud and sassy girl who is bad company for any child. The marketing team at Jumpstart apparently believes that their product won't sell if animated characters are courteous and supportive. I never buy their products anymore because I don't want to have to spend time reminding my son never to imitate the appalling behavior portrayed on Jumpstart.",108

0,it just keeps going.....,"I had to read this book for summer reading but i was still some what excited to read it. I was extremely disappointed. Ellis is an awful writer. He uses the same words and phrases over and over making the book even more tedious and boring. He never stays on topic adn manages to take every interesting point in the book and drag it out to the point that any interest he manages to spark is gone.Although the book does cover the ""founding brothers"" well it's just written poorly. Honestly i did learn things but im sure if I picked up another book out there covering similiar material, it would be presented in a more interesting and less rambling way. Anything would be better than this book. It took me an entire weekend just to get through one of the chapters, the book is that tedious.I dont suggest this book at all unless you are extremely interested in the topic and can manage to get over the horrible way it is written.",172
1,Camus as Robert F. Kennedy's Muse,"After reading ""The Myth of Sisyphus"", I begin to understand my hero, Robert F. Kennedy better now.It was during the years after the tragic death of his brother, President John F. Kennedy, that Robert was finally free for the first time in his life to struggle to create his own identity and sense of purpose.In his journey of self examination that followed John's assassination, Robert explored the writings of ancient Greeks, beginning with ""The Greek Way"" by Edith Hamilton.But it was in the existentialist writings of Albert Camus that Bobby Kennedy finally found a way of thinking that helped him to make sense of life's absurdities.For anyone who is facing some difficult or very strange challenges in their life, I strongly recommend a serious look at Albert Camus' writings, beginning with ""The Myth of Sisyphus"".It's not optimism, to be sure, but it does help one to make some sense out of troubling times.",153

Our son doesn't mind going anywhere now, he gets in and he is very comfortable. It is the Cadilac of carseats, and it has extra features that are nice, the recline and the adjustable headrest are great. Also the straps do not twist or get all out of shape, the nice thing on this one is that you can release the straps and you don't have to work or bend your child's arms to get them out it is very parent and child friendly.

0,Circumcision stance teaches social conformity,"Great Expectations happens to teach how to conform to societal standards and subject our babies to amputations so that their girlfriends can continue the same sexists attitudes and to perpetuate locker room bullying of intact and natural bodies. Perhaps it should also teach us to give our daughters breast enlargement surgeries before they are too old to remember it so that we can conform to the assumption that men like larger breasts, or we should perform labiaplasties on our baby daughters so they look like porn stars or barbies for their future boyfriends. Way to go Jones and Jones.This is in reference to this snippet: """"In America, many women are used to, and prefer, the circumcised look, and we can only assume that they assume their son's future girlfriends will too. Some dads worry that their sons will be teased if their looks don't conform to the majority of boys in the locker room.""""",154

1,Alba - a pleasant surprize,"I bought this cd after hearing Cocciante on ""A Christmas in Vienna"" DVD. When I got it in the mail, I was a bit disappointed that it was made in 1975. But I took a chance and kept it. I'm very glad I did. The album definitely reflects music from an earlier time - there's no disco or hard rock however. Most of the songs are simple, yet beautiful, sung from the heart. Cocciante's voice can be a bit harsh at times but usually his voice matches the music quite well. He is accompanied mainly by piano. I wouldn't recommend this album to everyone, but if you're sick of the same old stuff (with overdone instrumentals, pretentious lyrics, etc) this album may be a pleasant surprize.",126

But these lovely macros of the breed standards are really just incredible, from a fellow writer/photographer's point of view. Whatever your interest in these birds, be it a curiosity or a hobby, you will love this book.I also like the size. Easy to find on my overloaded bookshelves.

In fact, I was searching Amazon to buy one as a gift for someone this year. It's true that the thing eats up batteries like crazy when playing a CD, but I almost exclusively use it for the radio function. With just playing the radio and only using it when showering, the batteries last about 4 months.As I said, it's approaching a year old and all of the functions still work fine.As for the person who claimed that the manual said not to use it near water, that line was taken out of context. The manual says if you use a plug-in adapter don't use it near water. I'm guessing this is a safety precaution, not a wear-and-tear issue.",138

0,Ehh? Could be bigger.,"I am a minimalist to the fullest, but this book simply lacks depth. The ""blueprints"" are hardly viewable, let alone descriptive. Most of the structures resemble eachother and are spare, without furnishings or signs of life. I would recommend the book, ""PREFAB"" by Allison Arieff for bigger pictures, broader concepts and more in depth explanations. I suppose they were making a point by making the size of the book compact, but the few times I was impressed with a structure I would scour the three or so pages devoted to it and then it was over, leaving me wanting much more. Try classics like, ""Pierre Koenig"", by James Steele or ""Julius Shulman: Architecture and Its Photography"" by Peter Gossel. Ta Ta",121

I set the spindle of Memorex Blanks and the spindle of Sony Blanks next to each other, if you look at the color of the Discs from the side, the Sony Blanks just look like they are of better quality (Deeper Color) I highly recommend these.

1,classic - must read & REread,"This is a classic and a must read and reread for anyone seriously interested in examining modern claims to miraculous charismata. As a scholar and a christian man, Warfield has few peers. Jack Deere and others have tried to counter his arguments. Be sure you read Warfield for yourself. You should also read (for a Charismatic perspective) Jack Deere's book, Surprised By the Spirit. Then reread Warfield and decide if you think Deere adequately relayed and answered Warfield's arguments. Jack Deere's effort is the best so far, but he falls far short IMHO.This classic deals with miracles in a broad sense related to the modern Charismatic controversy. One noteworthy peculiarity of this book is Warfield's detailed examination of miracles in history and various groups.",124

1,Interesting Set-Up,"One Two Buckle My Shoe is one of the more contrived of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot novels but its twisted loops are definately part of the fun. The author does play around with politics in her conservative, often very naive, way but handles it much more smoothly than she did in her early twenties spy novels. The solution to the killer is both predicatable and satisfying as Christie crawls right up to the preposterous and then pulls back just a little. This is one of the Poirot novels that could have used Hastings a foil and his prescence is sadly missed, particularly as everyone at a certain dentist's office on a particular morning has something to hide and it would have been fun to read Hastings switching prime suspects with each new revelation. All in all, not a classic Christie but an interesting one.",144

0,Sound half good,After some very meticulous shopping I decided on the Shure E2c Earphones. My first problem was that the supplier shipped a different model with no real explanation for the difference or the spec difference between the units. My second problem was with the earphones themselves. Right out of the packaging I was disappointed to discover that only one channel worked. Almost nothing from the right channel unless I had the volume level at full and then it was only barely audible. I tried the earphones with various sound systems with same result. Called Shure and they told me to return them for a replacement set. This review will be continued. The left side seemed to sound just fine but I am concerned with Shure's quality control. How difficult can it be to verify sound coming from both channels in a set of earphones before you package them up in an impenetrable plastic shield? I expected more from such a renowned company.,161

This is utter rubbish. Art house vibe? Come on. That only makes sense if you believe that art house cinema shows films which are badly lit, poorly paced and badly acted. Depp reprises his 'Chocolat"" role to equally tiresome effect, while Harry Dean Stanton looks like an actor who can't wait for his character to be deported East by the Nazis and save him from further career trauma. I was interested that the Paris flat appears to be located next door to the city aquarium; during love scenes, the wooden lovers are serenaded by singing whales outside the window -now that is Arthouse, and accounts for this review's only star.The horse defecating on stage says it all; this really is a stinking heap",162

0,"Disappointing ""sound track""","The film Dead Man, is an interesting and sometimes hauntingly absurd film..verging on the philosophical, but without the music by Neil Young, it probably wouldn't be so successful. On the other hand, the music without the images is weak and not freestanding as it's recorded in this so called ""sound track"" CD. Even though Neil Young's expressionistic guitar playing from the film, still resonates as a powerful ""image"" in my memory, the CD falls way WAY short of the actual filmatic material.

0,Does not last,"Upon recieving this Lenmar battery, I inserted it into the Panasonic DMC-TZ3 charger and it readily charged with no problem. (Some reviews I read indicated a problem with this Lenmar battery fitting into the charger which I did not encounter.) I then put it in the camera and it has functioned as well as the original equipment. I have not used the camera enough to determine if there is any significant difference in usage time between it and the original Panasonic battery, but it is certainly a bargain price.UPDATE: After using this battery for a year it started not to hold a charge very long and eventually it would hardly work at all, so after usage, I found tis battery to be unsatisfactory and not that good a bargain. I am still using the original battery taht came with the camers from over 2 years ago. And I recently bought another backup battery on Amazon which seems to be working fine.",161

If you outsmart or out drive the computers cars you will see them granted acceleration speeds that can only be measured in Mach, and the cornering ability of a cheetah.The recovery times of the AI's cars when tricked or pushed into obstacles seems like a huge hand follows them and quickly corrects any mishaps. When you find yourself losing because you nick some corner within 100 feet of the finish, but had been in the lead until then, you want to chuck the cd's out the window. I used to be a fan of NFS series, but this installment has me doubting I'll every purchase it again.",137

1,ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE MONEY!!!,"The faucet filter is made the same way (probably the same place) as the main competitor. But this version(""complete"") is worth gold! We have saved soooo much in plastic bottles and new coffee makers. I love it. The threads should be brass, like the less expensive version, but outside of that, there is nothing better. The choice of filter, stream, or spray is what sets this faucet filter apart. I can get them to last about 2 years (if it is NOT used as a handle to move the faucet around). Have tried the less expensive version and hate it. It simply doesn't work very well. So save yourself the annoyance and buy the better version, treat it well, clean the faucet screen every month or two, DON'T use it as a handle, and you will be satisfied.",138

There are several talented authors still write in the BT story line such as Keith, Charrette and others.

Yes the characters could have had a bit more depth in them and it could have been a little longer, but ROC sets the limit. Against it was a solid story line that needs some polishing done.I'd like to see Mike Stackpole back writing more Battletech!",115
0,"OK, but not their best","There are a few decent songs here, but the special energy that Supertramp had on all their classic albums is gone here, and this is becoming a bit annoying at times, particularly Rick's writing which by now has gotten lazy. With a title like ""Put On Your Old Brown Shoes"", you just KNOW it's going to be some lame pseudo-jazz uptempo thing by Rick. Hodgson's stuff is starting to get whiny rather than positive - ""Crazy"" and ""C'est Le Bon"" are decent songs with nice melodies and hooks, though less original than his offerings on previous albums. The only song that was even a moderate hit, ""It's Raining Again"" is a decent song, but compared to previous albums, it's more of a jingle than anything else, with not-so-great lyrics (come on you little fighter / no need to get up-tighter). Overall, the lyrics are dark and despairing, and point the way to Roger's departure from the band, which goes out with a whimper not a bang.",166

0,not happy,My little dog is very used to having her teeth cleaned -- she likes it. She was not that happy with the gel but she still allowed me to clean her teeth. I didn't see any improvement in her teeth and I found it very difficult to use -- getting it out of the container onto the finger brush was just impossible. I had to open it and put it on a little plate and then dip the finger brush into it -- too fussy for my life. I didn't like the smell either.It's Feb 17 and I have gone back to her usual tooth paste and she and I are both happier. She likes the taste of her old paste and I prefer the efficiency of how much easier it is to use.,134

0,Slow Trip To Nowhere...,"Hmmm... Maybe I missed something or just don't get it, but this album is as irritating (...), all 10 songs bleeding into one another in a dissonant, clattering, droning mess. Guitars saw, drums pound and like the jazz song accompanying my worst nightmare, everybody plays something different all at the same time, singer Shawn yowling over the racket with all the charm of a flea-bitten cur that perpetually humps your leg. Call me a ""throwback,"" but there's something endearing about music with verses, choruses, melody, and a sense of purpose. These guys sound like they're making it up as they go along and for all we know, maybe they are. If your idea of a good time is an entire disc of variations on The Stooges' ""L.A. Blues"" (as much as you may love them, you have to admit that song blows chunks) performed by James White in the throes of a Tourette's attack, contact Estrus immediately.. (...)",158

He loves it! The dinosaurs are perfectly sized to hold and move around the play mat; they can hide behind trees and rocks; and the tub is most convenient for storage, and the right size for AJ to carry it to where he wants to play with it in my home.

Apparently, people eaither love it or hate it, and I most definitely hate it. The problem is even though its a nice tune, it doesnt go anywhere, and seems very lazy and uninspired. You cant deny that. I agree that she has lost some of her earlier spunk, but this new single really crosses the line and shows her to be talentless. Please do NOT purchase this single, as all long time Sinead fans have more or less washed their hands off her with this release. Very disturbing. The CD cover is ugly too, as you can see.",118

It REALLY damages your hair and is not worth your money since your'e going to end up buying at least three every year. I have bought this straightener four times already and never will again. Yeah, it may straigten your hair..but it will make it look dry and frizzy. It doesn't make it look shiny, and there are certainly better ones on the market that are healthier for your hair.",85

The sound is highly distorted at high volume and at regular volume, it sounds like my old transistor radio. I get better sound out of my [cheaper] speakers.As another reviewer mentioned, parts of the interior are exposed, which doesn't make much sense, and the batteries are very tricky to get in (and shouldn't battery insertion be a no-brainer??) The batteries are also very susceptible to being knocked around, they do not sit securely in their sockets.Overall, considering this system is 2 to 3 times what I would have paid for other speakers, I'm returning these.",110

I was very pleased with the four ITMFL and the other four 2046 bookmarks that were included. My only disappointment with this product is that no English subtitles are available in the Making of ITMFL/Deleted scenes DVD, whereas in the 2046 Making of DVD, they were included. Nonetheless, I still think this is a worthy buy for any big fan of Wong Kar-Wai's films, though the ITMFL Criterion Collection version seems to offer better features.",117

The guy on the line tells me to just delete the problem file and it will work. I asked him if this started my 30 day free phone support.. he said yes... after that it would still not burn a cd. but makes a lot of frisbys... I put it on another older pent III 800 MHZ machine.. same error message when installing .. but I knew which file to delete to get it installed... still it would hang up for 10 min at a time... just unbelievable...

Thickness of the tape and shorter life span have been a disappointment. Only way to break this item is to have the end pop off, and I have been noticing a disturbing trend for this to happen much sooner for the newer tapes than the older ones that I used in the past.

0,You call this a book,"I can not beleive that someone would even publish this sort of trash. I really hope that the author did NOT expect to get rich with this sort of filth. I am a PROUD african American Woman, and this book made me feel ashamed of my heritage. We no longer live in the early 1900's the world has evolved, it's time that these close minded southerners realize that they are not from this country either!!!I am guessing that the two good reviews that this book got were from family members, if so what a shame, but I see why, family is probably the only people that read this book. Save your money!!!",112
0,Penny Serenade-,"I was very disappointed in the product. The dvd case was so poorly designed that the dvd could not be held on its spindle and arrived badly scratched. The ""remastered"" copy appears to be a cheap bootleg with cheap paperwork copy, cheap holding case and cheap copying. Not a great copy. Yes, better than some of the others that are available. [...]",62
0,Poorly Written,"This is the worst book I have ever read. The writing is so poor it makes me think that the book was written by a high-shcool student in need of some writing classes. The message of being a so-called lovecat is so far from the truth in today's tough business climate that it is hard to imagine this book being nothing more than a throw back to the good old days of the Internet era. Finally, being nice to people instead of nasty is common advice that should find its way not in a book that you have to pay for, but among friends and family that are free and more credible.",112
0,The best scene was edited!!!!,"I saw this movie on television back in the day and enjoyed it. I found a VHS tape in K-mart 20 years ago and my kids enjoyed it growing up. I lost track of that video, so ordered this one recently. The quality is acceptable, but the best scene of the movie is missing!!!! At the very end, Joan van Arc says, ""It the last dinosaur, the last one"", and Richard Boone says, ""So am I"" - that scene is completely missing from this version of the movie. What a let-down!",91
1,Great Device- Buy it.,"I bought this device for my Dell' Desktop computer. I did not have a problem installing the software or the device. I followed the instructions very carefully as I knew, from the posted reviews, that people were having trouble installing it.Overall, the picture is better with DVD inputs, but an analog cable signal displays fine. Further, the sound is great. If you are looking for a high definition picture from this device, you WILL be disappointed.The device does use a lot of the CPU power. At some points, the device used up 40% of the CPU power.Balancing the pros and the cons, I am recommending this device to my friends and family.",112
1,Perfect for traveling,"It comes in a resealable plastic. It is about men's size 8, but the open toe accommodates a range of sizes. Cheap enough to dispose after a week's hotel stay, or sturdy enough to use for months.",37

0,It looks good,"It looks good in the store and out of the box but after I hooked it up and starting playing movies it would skip not on everything just certain movies and Tv shows it s a wierd skip ownly happening during scene changes it would leave a ""ghost"" of the previous scene in the new scene very briefly.I took it back to the store figuring it was just this unit but the next one did the same thing.I cannot recommend this product!",82
0,Not Recommended,"I think the author has talent, and I hope will one day write an interesting story really well. But this one isn't - even with dragons and sexuality and so on, it's boring. I would try another book of hers, outside this trilogy.",43
0,Wow! This is bad!,"Ok... I love pop. Good voices like Janet Jackson, Christina, and Kelly Clarkson all define the genre. This CD is so bad I felt like I was listening to a 5 year old singing nursury rhymes. That is how bad her lyrics sounded. Hilary Duff has her own TV show (just as bad as her CD by the way) and then all of a sudden she has talent and gets a record deal. What is going on? She is not pretty at all. Her voice sounds like it was fed through a machine. Wake up America!! If you want to hear real talent go buy ""Stripped"" (Christina) or ""Thankful"" by Kelly Clarkson",112

1,An old friend,"I remember this was the first volume of Dover piano music I ever bought, back when I was in high school in 1970 when it was first published. Then it cost exactly four dollars. I have played from it in all the years since then. The front cover long ago disappeared, but true to Dover's standards of sewing the pages in with thread like the best books, the volume is still intact.This is an generous collection of Debussy's earlier piano music, all from the original editions. A warning however, the original editions come with the original misprints, but most of these are obvious to the eye and ear.",108
1,Great Movie,"This is, without doubt, one of the funniest movies the late, great John Candy ever made. Richard Crenna is great as the rich, snobby dentist who thinks he owns Florida and tries to run Candy's family out by refusing their rent check (he owns thier rental house). Great performances by Candy, Crenna, and Rip Torn. I have only one problem with the movie....there is a great song by Jimmy Buffett called ""Turning Around"" which is featured in full as the credits roll, but the song is not available. I am a Buffett fan, but I have never seen the song in any recorded form, and there seems to be no ""Summer Rental"" soundtrack. It's frustrating to watch the movie, hear the song, and not be able to buy the song anywhere. Why Buffett never released it is beyond me. Anyway, the movie is great, the acting is wonderful, and the soundtrack is really good.Watch ""Summer Rental"" and be prepared to laugh.",161
0,A Great Way to Get Unexcited About Your Trip to Japan,"This Lonely Planet Guide is another copy of all the previous Japan guides with all the same disappointments.Coverage of areas outside of Tokyo and Kyoto is honestly rather shoddy, and they've kept the obnoxious negativity that makes an exciting trip to Japan seem like a waste of time. While other Lonely Planet guides are lively, with authors that seem to enjoy the travelling, Lonely Planet Japan's authors write as though they really don't like Japan. It is questionable whether or not the writers even visited the cities they are reviewing.This guide is probably most useful as a reference of places to look up on your own in another source.",109

These five homeless women talk about their experiences through life being homeless. If you are curious and want to find out more about homelessness, this is the book for you. After reading I Have Arrived Before My Words, I see homelessness in a different way. I never would have thought that being homeless would be so difficult.",76
0,Really pretty awful tasting,I bought this based on the other reviews and am incredibly disappointed. It is basically tasteless! I usually make my own bread from scratch (both white and wheat) and hoped to be able to just throw this in my bread maker when I'm in a hurry. We threw it out!,50
1,An accomplished novel!!,Waters is able to create a strange moody literary landscape--one that would never be in a bestseller. For me this is refreshing and interesting. Waters crafted the beginning and middle of the novel very painstakingly--I appreciated the craft but at times I wanted a little more variation in pace. She actually takes you into the musty constrained world of a slightly hysterical spinster--and makes it interesting because she unearths the passion underneath the surface.The ending felt a little rushed--but this might be because it was jarring and sudden for the protagonist and Waters brought me into her world.All in all a worthwhile read that takes you to another time and place!!,111

1,Great product .......but,"I have had the camera for 6 weeks and have taken several hundred photos, mainly of the America's Cup qualifying races in Auckland.One reviewer complained that the power button and shutter are easy to confuse. I fully agree, and have lost a couple of action shots through the confusion. My biggest problem is with the physical strength of the camera. I was taking pictures from a boat, and the lens gently nudged a bulkhead. This was a gentle nudge, but enough to dislodge the lens, which fell off completely when I shut the power down. The Fuji distributor in Auckland was fantastic, and repaired the camera promptly, and without charge. It was not the first time they had seen the problem, so be warned! I have a 64meg card, and this is more than enough.",135

1,4.5 Stars for a Grand Read,"I picked ""The Grand Sophy"" as my introduction to GH, and it's a WOW! Such a satisfying read, chock full of memorable characters, humour and a great detailed glimpse into the society, fashions and speech of the Regency period. I understand the author was the undisputed expert of this era and it really shows.Sophy is such a likeable manipulator, especially when scheming against her adversary, Charles Rivenhall. Many laughs at the predicaments and unexpected outcomes she finds herself in.Excellent detail on the carriages, horses and especially the manners of that time. I feel like I was whisked away in a time machine and stole a little glimpse into the chaos that follows The Grand Sophy. It was truly a delightful journey and am looking forward to delving into the other works by this incredible author.",135

It checked out up to spec on my multi-meter, and has operated for more than a month now under fairly heavy use.Absolutely no complaints from me. A very good battery for a fair price.",74

1,One of the most interesting stories I've ever read!,"I read many of the anthropological books on the ""Yanoama"" (uncommon spelling used in book) first but I learned more from this book than all the rest put together. She just tells her story, in great detail, and all the emotion and humanity comes out in the story. The people come across as individual people, not a monolithic species to be observed and catalogued in an anthropological zoo.It takes some time to get through and I never did keep track of which tribe was which and who's trying to kill whom, but you really feel for her and she really brings you into her world. Why this isn't #1 on the Yanamami reading list, or Amazon tribe reading list for that matter, is beyond me. It's maybe the most fascinating biography I've ever read.",134
0,"Tainted Love Becomes More Tainted, Musically","Club 69 has earned the reputation of making horrible remixes. Let's start with Yaz's ""Don't Go"" and ""Situation"". The remixes for these classic songs were worthless and unnecessary. The same thing has occurred with Soft Cell's ""Tainted Love."" Not only are the beats monotonous, but become boring and tiresome to the ears. I must admit, as a DJ, I like to make mix tapes where two songs mix nicely with similar beats. I was able to mix a remix included in this CD with Depeche Mode's ""Personal Jesus"", as they both sound alike due to the drum background. For this, I give this production one star. Maybe If I had the remix equipment, I could've have done a better job. But for now, for get anything remixed by Club 69. By listening to it, you'll be wasting away your haircells that can be used to hear something more delightful, such as the original release.",154

0,Avoid at all costs!!,"Avoid this DVD! This concert DVD is nothing more than a very poor copy of Donna's ""VH1 Live & More Encore"" DVD. The picture and sound are very low quality. The picture is dark and blurry and the audio sounds muffeled. Also, the order of the songs has been changed, which now leaves Donna's costume changes making no sense what so ever, since outfits now disappear and reappear through out the show. Tina Arena also now appears and disappears without any intro from Donna telling us who she is and why she's there. I have no idea why somebody thought is was a good idea to release this DVD, except maybe to deceive Donna's fans into thinking they were getting something they weren't! Take my advice and don't make the same mistake I did! Stay away from this DVD! If you haven't already buy Donna's DVD ""VH1 Live & More Encore"" you'll be glad you did.Donna",156

1,Incredible Read,"Like many, I was only introduced to this wonderful book (and the rest of the ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" series) from the also superb HBO TV series. I started reading the book a couple weeks before the TV show began, and I am completely hooked on the novels. Game of Thrones is nothing short of a sublime read that is intricate, intelligent, and epic all in one. I thought I had given up reading fantasy novels years ago, but now with this series, my interest has been completely renewed. There are so many well-developed and interesting characters here it is near impossible to choose a favorite, but needless to say ""The Imp"" is definitely one of mine!",119
1,A Better Tape!,"Purchased both front and rear louver sets. Rear set went on with no problems. The fronts were another story! The louver pieces resisted the contour of the fender. Went to the autoparts store and purchased 3m trim and decal adhesive. Apply a thin coat of the adhesive to the two-way tape on the louver, hold in place for 5to10mins and you will be good! They look super and give the fenders a nice highlight! Would recomend Karyakan use a little more bend at the factory and a better quality tape.",90

Of course I had to send it in (again at my cost) and after another 6 weeks wait they send me back the second unit in working condition - well it worked for about a month, which, for me included using it about three times.

1,Guidance for fulfillment of mans need to get laid.,"The Game is about how to get laid. It is not about how to grow and develope a meaningful and lasting relationship. For most young healthy and inexperienced men it is the perfect book to help them overcome and grow out of their shyness, fear, and confusion in dealing with women. And that is what young men need most. Women can be difficult for men from all ages and walks of life, one wrong woman can easily ruin a mans life if he is not very careful. This book tells you how to take charge of your life men, read it before you even think of saying hello to another female. The stuff they teach in school is crap, this is about what it is really about in dealing with the most dangerous creature to ever walk the planet, the human female!!!!

1,Into a New Neighborhood,"A deeply satisfying, rich offering from Ian McCulloch and company. McCulloch seems to have found some resolution since the fevered days of ""Thorn of Crowns"" and ""Over the Wall."" Ironically, my investment in the Bunnymen always had as much to do with Will Sargeant's swirling, swizzle-stick guitar as it did with McCulloch's brandy-rich vocals. On ""What Are You Going to Do"" Sargeant's chopping guitar has mellowed considerably; at first listen, his fingerprints seem missing here. However, like the album as a whole, after some careful forensics, you discover that both he and McCulloch are alive and well, having merely moved to a quieter neighborhood.",104

The bumps on their arms, thighs and buttocks became inflamed and red after using the scrub and I did not notice a reduction in the bumpy patches. I did however, get soft hands from applying the products to my girls.We visited the dermatologist last week. He was unfamiliar with this product, but prescribed a compound of 1% hydrocortisone in an acid mantel base with 10% urea. We've used this compound for only a week and we're already seeing a great reduction in bumps.I would suggest not paying the ridiculous price for this product.

Product is a complete rip off and a stain on Dyson's reputation. They should be ashamed of themselves for releasing something like this and charging $150 for it is the ultimate insult. You are essentially making a $150 donation to Dyson for a useless paperweight. Would not buy another one at any price. It has no electric option so it is dead weight when the battery stops and it will stop before you can even think about getting anything done with it.",126

0,Disappointment,"Although I've been a big fan of the Acid Jazz/Neo-Soul, I just recently had the pleasure of recognizing Kelli Sae as a great voice within the genre while listening to Incognito's Who Needs Love CD. I quickly became enamored with Kelli's vocals on Stone Cold Heart, so naturally I did an online search of Kelli's work, and found out about this cd. I purchased it the next day and even though I'm not a musician I could tell that this body of work was an overall poor production for such a great talent. There were only two songs that captured the quintessential elements of Kelli's talent (the very danceable ""Can't Wait"" and the very reflective ""Heaven""). Other than that the arrangements were amature when compared to Kelli's efforts on the Incognito CD I previously mentioned. As I said Ms. Sae has a tremendous voice and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one of her CDs, but do yourself a favor and save your money on this compact disk.",168
1,"shaken, not stirred","This set was perfect for a vodka comparison testing I hosted. The shaker top screws onto the glass base so there is no worry about it coming apart while shaking. It is glass so there is nothing but the ice cold taste of what you are shaking that comes through. The glasses were elegant enough and the perfect size for a tasting or for doing shots. The shaker is also great for making a couple of martinis at a time or any other shaken, not stirred drink. Overall, a great product for my needs.",94
0,This book is despicable,"Only an idiot or a criminal would follow the advice this author gives. His suggestions range from violations of employees' privacy (listening in on their private conversations, searching their personal possessions) to major safety issues (keeping the back door deadbolted so no one can get out). As someone who has been both an employer and an employee, I'm shocked and appalled at his complete lack of consideration for other people.I don't see how any person with a shred of intelligence or self esteem could stand working for an employer like this. I wonder how he finds time to work on implementing a strategic plan for the business when he spends all day snooping on his employees and micromanaging the cash register.And in case the author ever has a chance to read this review, here are a couple more clues to the mysteries of life:1. Your female employees are women, not girls.2. Winning the Superbowl is not the greatest possible success in the world.",163

1,I love this book.,"I realize that I am in limited company in loving this book. It is very strange and mixes (intentionally) poorly written pornography with rambling discussions of avant-garde literature, descriptions of the Scottish countryside, and ventriloquist's dummy who can think. There is sex and books and then more sex and more books. The plot is hilarious: a book within the book by a man who drags Princess Diana's corpse to ancient stone circles, a pair who drag a weighted ventriloquist's dummy to said circles to test the validity of said book.I write this positive review knowing that almost every reader will dislike this book. I eagerly await the day I meet someone else who loved it.",115

0,So so,"This set has some real gems on it. But in all honesty, the gems are few and far between. One disc is ""the Doors favorites"" that have songs that are on their other albums. And if you are the type to be buying a box set, you probably have those other albums, so don't need duplicate copies of those songs. There is one disc that is of the Doors live, and it's nothing that great. The gems include songs off their first demo tape (where, oddly, they sound kind of like the VELVET UNDERGROUND), and a great jazz version of QUEEN OF THE HIGHWAY, which I LOVE. It's the best thing on the album. So if you are a real Doors fanatic, you'll appreciate the gems on this album. But for everyone else, this isn't worth it.",137
0,For those in search of meaning,"For those in search of meaning in their life, pass this book by unless you enjoy a light, not very well written, redundant, and not very insightfull book that relates everything that happens in life and stages of life to the levels of a house. The analogy gets old by the second chapter. The author's insights are limited and of common knowledge to those who have been questing for meaning for 6 months or more. Pass on this book and look for a more meaningful book that does not try to fit everyone and everything into one of her house's floors. Life must be dull for this author because she seems to see in black and white rather than the way I see life: an irradiant rainbow of changing and unpredictable color combinations. I did not even finish the book - I felt my time would be better spent doing the laundry and day dreaming.",155

It has made it easy for me to flip thru MY favorite recipes and find a quick meal to make instead of going thru numerous cookbooks when time is of the essence. It's fun as well because instead of just writing the recipes down, I am making both color and black and white copies of recipes and taping them in the book along with pictures of what some of the recipes look like. I also have been able to write down recipes passed down to me by my mother that have no measurements, but I can cook them as long as I know the ingredients.It's a pretty book w/spiral binding and I am having a lot of fun with it.

Sure, Frank Rosolino is a great musician; buy his CDs. As a pundit and singer, he's awful. And what a shame to be barely able to hear the great Stan Kenton mellophonium orchestra.

Willie Nelson has a nice storyteller's voice and pace.The stories are told in a variety of 3rd person and 1st person perspectives. They range from manhunts to range wars. The heroes are hard, upright men and the villains are greedy and conniving. I love the attention paid to historic detail- language, guns, landscape, clothing, and even thinking.The stories may be short, but there is not shallowness or rushed pace.It comes in a nice wooden collector's case.I recommend this collection to any Louis L'Amour or Western fan.",125

Unfortunately after a fairly promising first fifty or so pages, the book disintergrated into a boring, badly written, snore-fest that really faltered whenever it left its two main characters. Although it could have been a truely epic tale, as written this book was at least 150 pages too long. More time should have been spent on Homo hadalis and the other neat (but underwritten) subterranean creatures and less time on all the pseudoreligeous garbage.

But Karen Black's performance is beyond emberassing, and Mike Patton even said himself he is no actor - and it shows.It was very uncomfortable and difficult to watch this film in its entirety, which is a real shame because it could have been an incredible experience.

In retrospect, although it is pretty mellow, I like this album better than most of the Heep albums themselves. In fact, you could almost consider this just a more introspective Heep album, as Hensley is their main songwriter anyways, and Uriah bassist Thain is also on the album. Some great songwriting here, and Ken's voice is as good in its own way as Byron's. One of my favorite albums after almost 25 years! I just wish he were still putting out stuff like this and ""Demons""!!",106

I used to really enjoy and appreciate his songs, especially back in the late '70s and early '80s with Genesis, and his first couple of solo albums. I remember when a new Phil Collins Cd was a cause for excitement. Now every song is full of light and fluffy synthesizers, and the melodies are so forgettable. They have no more staying power than a breeze through the trees in my back yard. There's really no point in talking about individual songs -- if you think of his songs for children's animated films, this album is like that only worse. Listening to this CD was a very similar experience to listening to elevator music for an hour.",149

0,Amazingly boring,"Ok, the special effects are great for the time this movie was made, but that's really all this movie has going for it. I am most disappointed by having to give this a full star rating. The plot is mechanical with a lame voice-over back story. The characters shallow and lacking any legitimate motivations or redeeming quality. Honestly, I can't see what all the hype is about.",67
0,Terrible Vendor do not use Comparashop,"Terrible product, arrived damaged, packaging was a joke...More off putting was Comparashop's terrible customer service. I was given the run around for two weeks, never got return phone calls, put on hold for up to 45 minutes and disconnected, dealt with extremely dull witted people who never had any record of who I was each time I called. After awhile they turned on an answering machine with no live customer service reps to speak with. Finally, resolved it through Amazon directly...do NOT use Comparshop unless your into pain and suffering.",90
1,Worked perfectly,"I was skeptical about this product, but given the price I said ""why not"" since I had these pesky birds using my covered patio as a haven from the Arizona heat and my patio furniture as their personal toilet. I cut (4) three foot pieces of the ribbon and clipped them onto a closed yard umbrella positioned close to my covered patio (sort of like a wind chime) and it's been several months now without a sign of white dung anywhere on my patio. Apparently the reflection paired with the regular breeze we have produces enough movement to keep the birds away. I couldn't be happier with this product. It doesn't keep the birds away entirely we still have them visit the edges of the yard, the waterfall of our pool along with some of our flowering plants mostly the smaller finches and hummers (all about 50 ft away from the tape), I could add some more tape in different areas but I don't really care if they're at the edges as long as I have a clean place to sit.",181
0,Fat and easily breakable,"At first I really liked this Gigabeat. It lasted about three months though as one small drop broke the player, disallowing it to play music.

The only thing I really liked about this Gigabeat was its loud sound.",76
0,This Music's Got Absolutely No Feel To It,"Simply put, this is one of the five worst albums/CD's I've ever heard and I've listened to well over five thousand of them.

I will avoid Energizer products in the future.,66
0,A lot of build-up with no pay-off whatsoever,"I have to agree with the reviewers who said this should have been a short story- might have made for a creepy Paul Bowlesian one.I could tell within the first 100 pages where the build-up was going nowhere and kind of lost trust in the author. I could tell that ""the plants did it,"" and the protagonists were not worth staying with for the duration, so I had to put it down. Looks like I made the right decision.",79

0,A bit too preachy and pretty..,"I grew up reading Johnathon Livingston Seagull over and over, and became a fan of Richard Bach after reading a few of his other books later in life, but with One it seems he's become too comfortable in his role as an always-inspiring and thought-provoking author, and didn't strain himself to be either. The book rambles on quite a bit and has an extremely different tone than something like Illusions. Still made you think a few times, but I definitely didn't feel at all enlightened when reading it. Very mushy and soft throughout, and occasionally even preachy and self-righteous. I'd recommend one of his earlier books over this.",108

1,Reviews from Brizmus Blogs Books,"What can I say? I loved this book. It was very much a Young Adult novel, and while I don't think I would recommend it to just anyone, I did think it was an exceptionally fantastic YA novel. There's spies, there's girly girls, there's love, there's comedy, there's fluff, there's action - what else could a girl ask for from a YA novel? And it's written in such a way that I believed I was actually listening to Cammie, the main character, and not Ally Carter, the author. A lot of YA authors, I find, have trouble making that happen.Anyhow, this book was just adorable. And come on, a book that happens in a boarding school for girls training to be spies - that's just awesome!Who Should Read This Book?Pretty much anyone interested in YA books, especially light-hearted, fluffy ones.",140
1,It's a western for people who like westerns.... DUH!,"This is a new western... will it go down as a classic -- no.

It is not entirely unpredictable, but who thought John Wayne wasn't going to ride off into the sunset?",61

A Day at the Circus also gives you a behind the scene glimpse of a world totally foreign to most of us which is a good lead-in to discussing how people are all different yet all the same. We need more shows like this to prepare our children for life. My granddaughter asks to watch it over and over again.",81

1,I COULD NOT IMAGINE WHAT SHE COULD POSSIBLY DO NEXT!!!,"I have been impatiently awaiting for this album:)...People say that they played a few of her songs on the radio so much that they didn't care to purchase the CD. Well... that is there lost because if you don't listen to the CD you are truly missing out:(Anyway - Back to the Voyage:) I could not imagine how India could possibly top the previous album. She did ""NOT"" fail me:) To be honest, when I listened to Acoustic Soul... I loved ""EVERY TRACK"". Now, with the Voyage... I love it... but I can't say better than the first. I am not disappointed at the least bit and I love 8 out of 10 songs:)That song ""truth"" is hot!!!! She has quite a bit of songs that are nice. She must be in love or something because she is showing how much she appreciates her ""King"":) I love her for that:)",150

The chapters I heard were SO bad...I wanted to take a shower afterwards, but being that I was at work I was out of luck. Knowing this terrible senator's political leanings and her impossibly stupid commentary in the media, I guess it isn't surprising this ditzy piece of trash came from her. What is surprising is that it was published at all. Have we no standards anymore? I had to give it one star because a zero star rating is not possible here.

For myself I got the latest and greatest from Nikon the 8800 and she got the Casio which she just loves.

It seemed like very time she took a picture someone would come over and ask about it. It is simple to use, ultra small and takes wonderful photos.",100
1,The only pen I will ever use!,"I work in a fast moving retail sales business where the pen is an important tool. I have used the Pilot Better Ball Point Pen for about 20 years. I use them all day, every day and these Pilot pens have never failed to write! These pens are in and out of my pocket many times every day, they always write and I have never had one malfunction in any way. The metal pocket clips never fall off, they always retract properly, etc. When I hand one to a customer to sign a sales order or receipt they frequently comment on how well they write. They are just the right size and while not fancy, they don't look or feel cheap. In my opinion, this the best pen available. They are just about impossible to buy where I live today, near Tampa, Fl. I am glad Amazon carries them. This is one the best products I have ever used.",159
1,Inside The Mind Of A Child,"My mother first bought this book for my oldest son. It has endured as a beloved favorite to all three of my boys. I think that children can really identify with Max and his thoughts. When he is sent to his room for misbehavior, his imagination helps him to run away to where the wild things are and collect his thoughts. I believe that the author must remember what its like to be a child and feel like no one understands, and not quite understanding yourself. Ruling the wild things helps Max understand that he just wants to feel loved, and helps parents to keep in mind that such outbursts from children are generally cries for attention--for someone to love them best of all. Mr. Sendak understands children! When you read this book it will transport you back to your own childhood and you will remember that lost feeling of being a child. Bravo, Maurice! You are my hero!",159

The good acting and gothic sensibilities of the movie were badly weighted down by plot holes and a ""surprise"" ending you could see coming long before it arrived.",80

The drawings in this book are absolutely amazing but I feel that for a beginner or novice it is terribly difficult to break them down into simple shapes and to figure out how to layer the shading. Even though this may have been a book book of drawing it is severely lacking in important basic information and should have been made even larger to accommodate a more in-depth approach.",126

1,A Fragile Time Captured,"""Blue Man Falling"" by Frank Barnard , is a fascinating glimpse into the fragile, often bizarre days of the ""Phony War"", that ""wishful thinking"" period of WW II when few believed the Nazis would actually invade France. Accordingly, one day we find an RAF Hurricane pilot engaging in a dogfight with his German counterpart and the next we see him enjoying a drink in a Parisian cafe. This jarring juxtaposition of moods illustrates all too well the surrealistic nature of that period. Mr. Barnard has a great ability to capture a ""sense of place"" whether he's describing a French farmhouse, a British barrack, or the Hotel Crillon. He also portrays convincingly the comaraderie and the rivalry among the ""blue men"", as well as their romances. I found this to be a very readable and well written book about a period not widely understood.",143

The problem is getting any heat at all. As I said in the title line, this is the worst pad I've ever used.",81
0,The Emperor's New Clothes,"I have been teaching calculus at a university for over 20 years. I was on the adoption committee to select calculus texts. I had heard that the Stewart text was a national best seller, so I volunteered to review it. I was startled. I can see now reason why this text is widely used. It is even more difficult to believe that its author has had any classroom experience with honest-to-goodness calculus students. The writing is rambling and obtuse. The design is not helpful and blends prose with examples. The art is irregular, some art is small and some is huge, some topics that cry for graphs have none and some that don't need graphs have several. I have used several other texts and it appears that the author used a cut and paste technique to create this text, taking liberally from other best sellers. After a careful review of this ""popular"" text, I felt obligated to write this review. Someone needs to point out that the ""emperor is not wearing any clothes!""",173

A great conflict is produced when Mark has to struggle between his growing love...and concern... for his soulmate and his faltering marriage. Very true to life. And the conversations throughout are realistic and flowing. I loved the ending. It makes me hope for true love, and it makes me believe there is a reason for our soul mates, even if we haven't realized we've met them yet.",122
0,My two cents,"""These current defacements are just the beginning.

1,Exceeded my expectations,"I ordered this bed for my 4-year old as he was outgrowing his toddler bed. I had my sights on this bed for awhile; however, I was hesitant based on some poor reviews and the fact it was made from particle board. I decided to take a chance and ordered the bed using Amazon's free shipping and it still arrived ahead of the schedule delivery. It arrived intact with no cracks or other signs of defects as others had experienced. Assembly was easy; those claiming difficulty were either incapable of operating a phillips screw driver or looking at directions. Even with the drawers installed, there is still plenty of usable storage space behind the drawers for items such as seasonal clothing. To access this additional space, simply move the mattress and lift the included bunkie board which consists of two half pieces - not that hard. If you're looking for a decent bed and don't wish to spend a lot of money, this bed is highly recommended.",167
0,I GOT THE LEMON,I might be the only one unhappy with this product but after I lifted the mattress off of the box springs and started to attach it to the frame the buckel broke.

A true prophet will always point to Christ, through the Bible and not to themselves. As much as I liked Rick's writings in the past I'm afraid he's fallen into deception of the worst kind - he believes he's a prophet. John the Baptist was the 'last' prophet, ""for all the prophets and the law prophesied until (up to) John."" (parentheses mine - Matt. 11:13) Christians must remember that anyone who claims to speak for God will point to the Bible as the 'final authority' - not dreams.",105

This grip has a great feel and seems to fit my average sized hands nicely. I'd have given 5 stars if it had a larger thumb swell and a cover for the bottom so it could be used to store small items. I would recommend this grip to anyone with a AR15 style weapon.,78
1,Best place to experience the cult of the New American chef.,"""The husband-and-wife writing team of Andrew Dornenburg and Karen Page -- he is a chef, she a journalist -- has produced four books in the past six years, and these are the best place to experience the cult of the New American chef. The most over-the-top of their books is the second, CULINARY ARTISTRY, which is dedicated to 'the original Creator' and goes on to treat the chef as being only a small notch down from Him. 'We have been awed by the unusual levels of perceptiveness we've experienced America's leading chefs as possessing; we believe some to have certain skills of extrasensory perception,"" they write. The assumption underlying CULINARY ARTISTRY is that being a great chef, like being a great artist, is far more a matter of talent than of training, and that making great food is a matter of imaginatively, instinctively combining flavors -- Abstract Expressionism with coulis.""--Nicholas Lemann, THE NEW YORKER",154

1,one of his best...,"I have read most of his books and was delighted with this one. The adventure and the story line taking place in Spain was great. I realized how little I knew about Spainish history. What a great author, I was ready to join the rebels when the convent was attacked...",50

1,good movie...,another comic book turned movie... the late hulk movie about 20 years ago was a ed wood in my book but this one is loaded with cgi and just a good movie. better then daredevil the action is great except for the carried on begining... they dragged on the characters a little to much. well not as good as spiderman or x men it is deffetally a good movie to see on a boring day interesting tid bit that ang lee the director turned down the change to direct terminator 3 to direct this! COMPLETELY SURPRIZING but probably should have been,101
0,Blargh,"Another one?I saw this on Disney's cartoon channel. (Toon Disney?) And I was so very glad I had not invested any money in purchasing or renting it. It felt cheap, corny, and just wrong. Why did this film need to be *made*?The film was really three different stories - and I felt that each one added very little to the Cinderella story at all. The fairy godmother is just now apparently everyone's fairy godmother. Even the mouse!While some younger girls I know liked the film, they agreed it wasn't up to the standard of the orginal stories. Frankly, Walt Disney would be sick. Why he isn't haunting the heck out of the company's higher-ups, I'll never know.Don't bother with this one.",121

0,How did it happen?,"Well.. This record were as far from the word quality you can come. The movie was so great. Then how did the album get so bad? Basicly Mychael Danna have three loops. One indian style, one screaming turkish guy and one set of drums. Then he makes this fuzzy, disgusting soup outof it. 50 minutes of a turk in pains.. I'm ashamed because i bought this record. But, if you didn't like the movie. You might just have the bad taste it takes to like this album",87
1,Spunky and original...,"This CD from Shakira is really great. Most of the songs, with a few exceptions, are catchy, spunky and original. Although her lyrics in English are occasionally a bit awkward (for instance, ""Whenever, Wherever"" sounds much better in Spanish) this is understandable given that it is very difficult to translate songs from Spanish to English. But the freshness and originality of most of her lyrics makes up for their awkwardness.Also, the songs are very energetic and catchy. If you are feeling upset, just turn on the first song, ""Objection"" - it is guaranteed to cheer you up. Additionally, as shown by ""Objection,"" Shakira does an excellent job of combining traditional latin music, like the tango, with modern rock guitar sounds. The result is a unique and original sound! Anyhow, if you don't have this CD, you are truly missing out. Get it soon, and enjoy!",145

0,"Academic, Not Practical","This book is good for academics that need a history of focus groups and a summary of research studies that investigate the technique itself. This is an interesting history, with many studies weighing in on what makes focus groups better or worse. But, as a practitioner, there is little that I found particularly new or insightful in the book. I think that Stewart's work is a better guide for someone that needs details on how to conduct a focus group. So, while good for PhD students, this book I found less good for managers.",94

1,Timely and Spiritual - Beautiful,"This movie is a rather hokey making of the story of St. Francis of Assisi. Having said that I must say I found it beautiful and moving beyond belief. However, I was so moved I bought 7 more copies and gave them to my family and only one person thought of the movie as did I. If you are not a person inclined to believe that people can connect to an unseen world for spiritual reasons, then you will not get anything out of this movie. However if you are such a person you will be greatly moved. I very much recommend this movie. The songs by Donovan are again hokey but fit perfectly into this movie.",117

I had finished it by next afternoon. This is such a remarkably wonderful book; deep and simple at the same time. It left me thoroughly enthralled, and I have already reread it thrice.I'd highly recommend this book!",85

Concepts are only briefly explained with some derivation of equations and definition of the variables. Examples are useless for students that need to see an actual calculation to do problems since most read like mathematical proofs. Yes, the problems are good.....but they'd be better if the text supported their difficuly, in which a good 90% dive into concepts that students have not encountered in the reading.Lectures are short and most are taught by individuals that could care less about intro physics students, so the student must learn a bulk of the course outside of the classroom.

Some of the interviews are interesting tibbits into small section of the BDSM world, mainly the working aspect of BDSM. I am not impressed by the selection of people who he choose to interview, and frankly don't think it reflects the life style. It does provide some insight into the life Domme who does it as a job, which manages to redeem it into having some value.

0,Better conversation starter than function,"I am skeptical about all these gadgets shown on TV, but this one was priced where it just seemed worth trying out. I do think it creates more conversation than cooling.The weakness of this unit? The unit has to be pointed directly at the sun. I figured if the sun was within about 45 degrees from either side of direct sunlight, the unit would power up the fan, but it does not.What I found works better for me is leaving the windows down just a quarter inch and having a side window vent on the vehicle. Side Window vents are perfect for protecting the vehicle from an unexpected shower while parked and also conceal that your windows are slightly opened. They also reduce road noise when the windows are closed, but you can also vent your car while driving when it is raining out too.Lastly, it doesn't slice and dice. Okay, not all TV gadgets slice and dice.Pretty neat idea, just needs more solar panels that are directed in more directions.",171

It does have a couple of great matches that some people may have forgotten along the way. Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle at No Way Out (which they were actually trying to get for Wrestlemania 22) was great and John Cena vs. Chris Jericho at Survivor Series 2008, a few good matches, but not enough to get the dvd.

So when I release the wire, both male end and female end gets un-winded.I wish there is a lock of some sought to the reel. When you are using it tends to turn and loosens the wire. When it is time to wind the cord, you got to tighten the loose wire before you wind it.On the whole, I like the product. I will recommend it.",111

[My musical tastes run from medieval plainchant to show music.] Hilary Hahn has incredible talent - I have followed her career ever since hearing an NPR interview when she was 13. Her violin playing becomes more lovely with each recording (this is no. 3). The two works on this CD are lyrical, evocative and very American. The Meyer, in particular, has themes of folk melodies and is reminiscent of Copland. Meyer wrote this piece for Hilary Hahn and the work and her playing are stunning. This is a recording to listen to over and over again.",122

0,Starts okay but then....,"The book started out fine. I liked the first half - then it was boring, badly written, and way too self indulgent. I too bought it based on the comments on the front and back cover and thought a NY Times book reviewer probably knew what a good book was. The last half needed to be much shorter - somewhat of a clever idea but didn't quite work in reality.",70
1,An extraordinary gift!,"I bought this book after reading a review someplace else and was so glad I did. It's just a lot of fun to read, in fact, I've found that since I finished it I'll pick it up and flip through it because it always brings a smile to my face. It's full of ordinary things from the author's life, but it's those simple, every day things we can identify with that makes it so fun. And while it looks like it's a book for young women, I think it can be enjoyed by men as well as readers of any age. It also makes a wonderful gift, especially for hard-to-shop for people on your list.",115

There are many different types of characters to choose from and the game play is pretty smooth, though it can be glitchy at times. I'd recommend that you save often, as this game is known to crash unexpectedly. Other than that, I have no complaints, for the price, you can't get a better game of it's type.",78

0,Too Bad I Can't Rate it Zero Stars,"This has to be the most over-hyped piece of bad writing in a long while. The characters are unbelievably dull and naive, prone to coming to brilliant deductions 80 pages after the reader has figured it all out. Speaking of characters, there are too many of them who just fill up the pages and don't add to the story. I didn't think much of the vaunted research either. I'm no Dracula scholar, but I didn't read anything in this book that I hadn't come across in reviews of old Christopher Lee movies.The only good news in this is that it took Kostova 10 years to write the book. Maybe we'll have 10 years of peace before she finishes another one. Let me guess: Dracula resurfaces in Philadelphia and ....",129

Halgin and Whitbourne even try to make it a little interesting by placing ""Mini Case Studies"" throughout the chapters to display theory application. A definite addition to a beginning psychologist's collection.",91

With my snake-phobia I was shocked at one scene.The movie beginns mysterious, Anthony Perkins character enter in a mysterious world, a mysterious forest (and the jungle can be very mysterious).I enjoyed very much the movie. The art decors / jungle looks great. Henry Silva is perfect for his role and also I liked Anthony Perkins (at this time 27 years, 3 years younger than his Co-Star Audrey Hepburn).The DVDThe picture quality looks very good. So much better than I have expected for a not restored/remastered movie!The Sound: very good too in STEREO - Bronislau Kapers score sounds great.The only one and biggest MINUS point I have: NO SUBTITLES for deaf hearing people, so its a little bit difficult for me to understand every word.TRIVIA: this was the first Hollywood movie shot in PANANVISION!!!",157
1,A Painter with a View,"Susan Bennerstrom's work is deceptively simple and pleasing, but as you peel away the gorgeous colors and ubiquitous lines, you'll find a rich, complex emotional life. Could it be that Ms.Bennerstrom has wrapped her glorious vision of the world in seductive shapes and colors so that we'll come inside and experience it with her?This book is just as inviting as Bennerstrom's paintings and contains rare insight into her work. For example, I would not have guessed at Bennerstrom's influences--Italian painters of the 20's and 30's. The writers of this book have made me curious them, too.It is rare to be given a perspective on a painter who is in the midst of producing her best work. Hopefully, there will be future editions of this book that will keep up updated on Ms. Bennerstrom's world view.",135

Meticulous research as to which tunes are of ""true Moravian"" heritage or borrowed from other sources. Not dynamically written, but chock full of history.",78

0,The PICTURE of the Item I purchased was not the same as what I received.,The picture with the listing of the Leatherman Wave was shown with a leather and nylon sheath which was an important reason why I ordered that particular one. It allows me to have the Leatherman on my belt sideways and it also has a pouch to hold the extra drivers that come with it. When I received my Leatherman It came with a leather sheath that will only mount upright on my belt and does not even hold the additional driver tips. I needed the tool that is why I purchased it so I don't want to half to deal with sending it back over a sheath so I will now half to order another one from somewhere so I can tack on another 10% of the cost for a new sheath.,132

1,Pretty imaginative,"For someone so young, this first book is quite complex. So waht if the author borrowed on a theme? Most published works these days are rarely an original thought.Eragon has accomplished in one book what it took the first four of the Harry Potter series to achieve. The book introduces us to a world of innocence that is quickly overshadowed by harship, mistrust, hard-won friendships, war, and politics. I also love the sassiness of Saphira. I do love Harry Potter, but I place Eragon much closer to my first love which is the Lord of the Rings trilogy.In a world where it is so hard to get some youngsters to pick up a book, I'm glad that one had enough imagination, drive, and support to write one.I look forward to the future of Eragon.",134

0,An Above Average Musical-Made-Movie,"I really don't understand all the hype and praise surrounding this movie. It is nothing new-- ""Chicago"" has been around in some form or another for 70 years or so. It is pretty much like every other musical I've seen, maybe a little better than average-- Entertaining, but not something that you will look back on for years to come. Even a movie like Forrest Gump, an imperfect movie that somehow won the Oscar, is more of a classic. Rent, don't buy, with low expectations, and you might be entertained. Just don't get sucked in by ""all that jazz.""",99

The time I've spent listening to it is no longer markable in hours. We are looking at days here now. I am not entirely sure that all the #1 hits are on here but enough are for me to enjoy the whole thing.It is also filling some gaps I have in my newly forming Beatles collection. Some of their songs it seems aren't on the albums and this CD got them in my hands and ears. That shows the value of the CD right there.Very enjoyable and highly recommended.",110
1,"Not perfect, but it works...","This rake seems to have a nice design and is fairly light weight. If you just use 1 extension piece it's pretty sturdy and looks like the photo on the box - a straight pole. But we were very surprised to see how much bow there is to the pole when you've got more extensions attached to it. The longer it is, the more the rake ""dips"", and it becomes pretty awkward to position it where you want it. It felt something like trying to land a great big fish with one of those old fashioned long bamboo poles!But at any rate, for us, it was still a good purchase because it allows us to reach every inch of our 1 story home's roof. (So we can drag down all the big cotton piles which accumulate from our neighbor's cottonwood tree and never seem to blow off.) I'm sure in winter it'll work great to scrape just a few feet of snow away from the edge of the roof/gutters - because we'll only need 1 extension to reach - but it's still August, we're not anxious to test that!",189

0,I do not recommend this book,"I was looking for specific advice about ""how to shoot"" my kid (photographically). I did not get it. This book REALLY IS just a photo album of the author's own kids. While some people may be able to infer how to achieve great photos of their kids by looking at Mr. Elgort's photos, I needed more ""how to"" instruction. There is very little text in this book at all and I felt the title was misleading. If you are looking for excellent instruction on how to photograph your children (babies in particular) buy HOW TO PHOTOGRAPH YOUR BABY by Nick Kelsh, a far superior book which I bought after trashing this one.",112
0,What a disappointment,"Whilst Loretta Young unquestionably lead an interesting life, you would not know it from this whitewashed, saintly version. This book would have been far better promoted as a commentary on Loretta Young and her relationship with god. Certainly those readers wanting to know about her experiences in Hollywood in the 1930s would be disappointed. Her screen career was largely glossed over - we are talking about a woman who worked with pioneers such as Lon Chaney - you'd barely know it from this book. Similarly, there was little on her relationship with her sisters or any comments of substance about their lives or careers. Even the more 'scandalous' elements of her life were only worth a couple of pages - the rest of the book was more like a conversion exercise. Whilst the religious element was obviously something that influenced who she was as a person, the author did not delve beyond this. It is an injustice if this is the best that can be offered in her memory.",169
1,"Exactly ""as advertised"". Useful.","The National Parks are great, and they get all the glory, but it will repay you to visit some of the excellent state parks of the Southwest.

He undresses in front of the lake, revealing his impressive ass, and then another great ass shot as he surfaces, the water running over his round, wholesome cheeks. This is the only reason I gave the film 2 stars, other than that it's a boring waste of time. You're better off reading James Michner's book.",69
1,Chill Comp,"I enjoyed this CD. It has some very rare tracks, and if you're a Ministry of Sound or Euphoria fan, you'll be a bit interested in hearing where some of the DJ's inspiration seems to come from. For example, the track by ""Chant"" was redone and made countless times and is probably more commonly known because of the DJ ""Chicane"", who sampled the track in ""Saltwater"". If you've heard that track, Chicane's version, and enjoyed the ambient version of it, you'll more than appreciate the original of the song. It's fantastic and far superior.But that's the sort of cd that this is. More along the lines of a ""Euphoria Chilled Out"" meets ""Break N Bossa"" sort of thing with a hint of Arabic and Indie ambiance in between. Hard to describe - judging from what I've seen of the Buddha Bar series, I'd say they're pretty close. I'd recommend this one.",151
0,Don't Torture Youself,This is by far and away the worst Triple Crown book ever. I don't know how a book can be published with words like open being mispelled. The book was double spaced which I really don't understand and I found that truly distracting. From page one I knew I wasn't going to like the book. But I was very bored and finished it anyway in 3 hours. The writing style is so simple it seems like its for a person in grammar school. There was no real plot. No interesting characters. And an another major problem the book would talk about Detective so and so for seven pages and the next paragraph it would switch to another character's perspective. There was no transitioning between different characters stories. The ending was stupid. Surprising but stupid. Please don't waste 15 dollars and I wouldn't even recommend borrowing it from the library. This is the worst Triple Crown book ever.,157
0,Misappropriate title will disappoint all readers,"This book is a poor attempt by the author to share his insight during a tour on a fast attack submarine. Written on the level of at best a fifth grader, it embarrasses anyone wearing dolphins, and to those not wearing them, makes the dolphin wearing community appear as dolts. On every submarine there are some individuals that stand out as""shit-birds"". These are normally new kids who know everything, and don't realize that among the crew, nothing is sacred, and no personal secret is safe during the long boring watches stood from the Ballast Control Panel (BCP) in control, to the engine room rover.

I have the PC game and throughly enjoy it but I think Maxis struck out with this version. The controls are difficult to get used to and the game doesn't have a lot of variety. There aren't a lot of skin choices, or a lot of things to buy. However, I do like the feature that you are allowed to build and furnish a house on the lot before you move a family in. This is an option not available in the PC game. I wouldn't recommend this to any of the PC games fans for the mere fact that it just doesn't even begin to measure up.",131

1,No Problem with Windows 2000 Professional,"I wrote this review in response to another review about the ""problem with Windows 2000 Pro"". I had this IOGEAR GHE135U enclosure with my old hard drive (ATA66) with Windows 2000 Pro SP3, it has no problem at all. The Windows 2000 found it and installed it as ""Disk Drive"" at very first time when connecting it. About this, it is also clearly stated at its manual...""no driver need for ME, 2000, XP"". The only thing I don't like is the extra external power adapter; however, I beleive it is a must in order to provide the extra voltages for the regular hard drive (12 Volt/5 Volt). I like the big switch in the front panel, which allow me to just turn if off (after I 'Stop' it at the OS) without need to unplug it.",136
1,This Guy Does Good Pictures! (so said one of the kids),"and Mom agrees!Mr. George and the Red hat is a beautiful book! The illustrations are delightful. You really can imagine yourself among the sun-dappled trees in the park. The scenery is touched with light and soft detail. The colors are rich and warm. You can see the texture of the canvas in the pictures.The story is equally charming. Mr. George is the neighborhood squirrel. Maybe he lives in your park. One day he finds a red felt doll hat. He imagines which animal it belongs to, a chipmunk perhaps? He finally decides the hat is perfect for him and for helping him collect nuts. The other park animals admire Mr. George and his wonderful hat. In a generous act of kindness, he offers his hat to a young mother bird that needs a home for her babies. It's a perfect new home!You will just have to wonder if the squirrel you see in the park is Mr. George the generous squirrel.",161

0,Disappointing Follow Up to Volume 1,"If you got Dance Essentials, volume 1 and expected the second rendition to rival it, you will be sorely disappointed. This CD lacks the energy and constant ""up"" of volume 1. I have listened to volume 1 over and over and over ad nauseum, and STILL, I smile every time I hear it. I found myself jumping ahead to the next song on volume 2 due to the monotonous rhythm and lack of interesting vocals or accompaniment. What a disappointment. I will surely not RUSH to get volume 3.Too bummed ...",91

0,The worst movie ever made,"Nora Ephron should be tied to a fencepost and beaten unconscious for making this drek. Look beyond the fact that this movie is one long commercial, no other film has more product placement. The insidious message of the film is the inevitability of corporate domination. Meg Ryan, the small business owner, has her bookstore driven into the ground by Tom Hanks and his Borders type mega-store but all is forgiven in the name of love. I've never known destroying someone's livelihood to be an aphrodisiac. The rest is by the numbers romantic comedy. One star is beyond generous. Trite, shallow, saccharine, completely without merit. Everyone involved should be shot!",109

0,Don't waste your money or time!,"I liked the idea of not having to lift the mattress to position the bed ruffle, but it doesn't work. Parts of the skirt ride up in between the box spring and mattress, leaving that part of the ruffle several inches off the ground. Other parts slide down on the box spring leaving the bottom dragging on the ground. It's impossible to keep the whole thing in place and equally level to the ground. I'm always tugging it down in places, or pushing it up in other places. I guess the idea is for the weight of the mattress to keep it in place, but it doesn't on my bed. Also, the material is thin and looks cheap. And it doesn't go around an entire full size bed, so you better have part of the bed against a wall. I wish I had sent it back during the 30-day return period.",151

0,2 Different shows,"I am a big fan of Touched by an Angel. However, this episode can be divded up into two separate programs. The first starring Roma Downey was a 5-star episode. Roma's encounter trying to be a singing star along with her experience in jail, make this worth watching. The second was the part with Charlotte Church, who IMHO is the worst excuse for an actress ever to blaze her way on to the boob tube. If you can overlook this young girl's attempt at acting, you may find the entire episode to be enjoyable. I made this review 1-star because the episode is being sold by Amazon as a Charlotte Church Video. However, it may be better left as a Charlotte Church Video than a Touched by an Angel Video. Could have been a TBAA classic without CC.",138
1,Outstanding,"What a great scale. My husband and I forgo the ""Hal""-like aspects of this machine, figuring that our weights we would just as soon keep to ourselves. But the documentation that came with the scale persuades us that programming would be a cinch. We've used the scale -- him weekly and me daily -- for about six months now. It stows easily under a shelf in our bathroom and the battery seems to be holding up just fine. The VERY LARGE NUMBERS are a boon for our middle-aged eyes. Like the previous reviewer, I looked at a number of scales, including more expensive ""doctor's office"" type equipment. The more I looked, the more convinced I became of the high quality and good reliability of of Tanita equipment. We're very pleased.",130
0,Very disapponiting,"Having loved the first season I was extremely disappointed in season 2. The stories are tedious and depressing. The constant argueing is simply irritating - nothing more. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the characters of Tyra and Lyla are just so good looking that I couldn't completely hate it. Also, I believe, due to he writer's strike the season ended rather abruptly - in a way I was happy about that because I couldn't stand the sight of ""Smash"" anymore nor the near constant stuttering of Matt Saracen and Julie Taylor - I mean give it a break already. Let's hope season 3 is better.",113
0,I just can't get into it,"Loved Gibran's, The Prophet and bought this book after it was recommended as being similar. I just can't get into it. Sure, its a classic, but it is one of those books that need a study guide. The poetry is overshadowed by Rumi's relationship with another man; Shams. Was this a homosexual relationship? Was that why Rumi's son had Sham killed? Maybe I need to put the book away for a few decades and read it again later.",78

0,"Decent hardware, horrible software","I have had the WMA11B for over a year now. It is the worst piece of consumer electronics I have purchased in 20 years. The device itself is nice. It is small, connects easily, and sounds good. The PC software on the other hand is pathetic, and even worse, Linksys has essentially abandoned this device. Others have written about XP SP2 problems, but Linksys is clearly over their head in this market. This device only works with obsolete versions of Microsoft .NET. Microsoft has released at least two versions, plus fixes, beyond the version supported by this. The host software also has trouble when you rip new music and add to the managed folders. The Linksys loses track of huge portions of the music folders until you reboot the computer. Very amateurish effort by what otherwise is a decent company. Stay away.",142

Get ""Donde estan los Ladrones.""This cd does have one song I liked on the disk ... in Spanish (Suerte). The English counterpart wasn't as pleasing.

1,A More Complex Tale for slightly older readers,"A comparison to Hyland's ""Wreck of the Ethie"" is unavoidable since this book uses the details of the 1919 shipwreck (although author Joan Hiatt Harlow sets the disaster in 1912). Differences abound, however, in Harlow's additions of relationship complexities and her drawing class and cultural tensions between various groups of islanders. The book reveals a great deal about life for fishermen on the island of Newfoundland and of the immigrant Irish culture. The book would probably be meant for a slightly older audience than ""Wreck of the Ethie"" because of the various group tensions, but I actually feel the this book does not do as good a job depicting the shipwreck (perhaps because the point of view is solely from the shore rescuers whereas the ""Ethie"" offers both points of view). Excellent cover art and good prose.",137

That takes about 4 Meg--plenty of room for other regions as well. Because GPS signals are so weak, the antenna needs to be exposed to the sky to keep a good signal. The flat back of the eMap makes a strip of velcro easy to apply to allow mounting of the unit on the shoulder strap of a backpack. The features aren't as numerous as the Garmin III+, but it covers all the basics and provides a large, crisp screen.

I was in a fossil/rock booth at a summer show and was telling the proprietor that he would love the book I had just read by Richard Kellogg. He said ""Hi I am Robert Kellogg - Richard is my brother"". What a small world! I asked him if the story was true and he claimed it was according to his brother.

Also, some movies were left off this list that I couldn't understand why. Movies such as ""The Exorcist"", ""Rain Man"", ""Touch Of Evil"" and ""The Lost Weekend"". Still, there are a few movies on the list that truly deserved to be there. I'm not talking about the usual fair such as ""The Godfather"", ""Casablanca"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"". These movies truly do deserve to be on this list, but movies I wouldn't expect like ""The Manchurian Candidate"", ""Fargo"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"".

1,Alanis's Best Work,"This amazing CD had the misfortune of being the follow up CD to Alanis Morissette's classic ""Jagged Little Pill"". It is unfortunate because the two CD's sound nothing alike.SFIJ is one of those CD's that I consider to be ahead-of-it's-time. The production by Glen Ballard is amazing and, imo, superior to the work he did on JLP. The Eastern sounds - especially the guitars are hypnotic and work so well with Alanis's lyrics.Hopefully SFIJ will be re-released and re-mastered one day (for it's 10th anniversary perhaps?) as it is the essential CD if you are an Alanis fan...start with JLP if you are a newcomer then come to this.

0,"Crashes, doesn't load up etc etc","I should have read the majority of the reviews before I tried to install this piece of crap. Won't load cab3 files. Won't load, can't play it, no good , piece of crap.If you need to spend as much time looking for and applying fixes and work arounds to make software run then that's just a sign of extremely sloppy production practices. Do they test these before releasing them, what's the story?A very frustrating waste of time and energy.I will not be looking for any Siera products in the near future you can count on that.",96
0,Double Stroller Difficulty,Cons:Easy of use very very poor.Cheep constructionNot able to use stroller visors when using baby car seat.Front seat tray is very difficult to open and close.Very hard to open and cloths stroller.Pros:Ligth weightDoes not tip with one child in use.Resonable shock absorbption.May not be specific to this stroller but the design of front back is difficult to turn and dangerous in parking lots. Its very hard to see who is comming without putting your little onse in harms way.,79
1,Great Fun,"Anyone who is an Enix fan will find this game to be satisfying. I never played the original on the PSX, to be honest, I only bought it because it said Square on the cover, but I was pleasantly surprised with the game. The voice acting is decent, the FMVs are pretty awesome, and the gameplay itself is involving. I love the idea of a 2D dungeon crawl with RPG-style fights. I love the Norse Mythology theme, and I love the open ended style of the game. All in all, it's a great distraction from the same old RPG.",99
1,Seller Support was Excellent,"The order was promptly filled and the item shipped and delivered on time and expeditiously as expected.

1,4 out of 5,"For the most part, I agree with the other reviewers, it certainly is an eye opening book. However, roughly 25% of the book does not flow with the theme of the book, especially Chapter 12 by Karl Idsvoog.

1,MINISTRY LIVES!,"The world at large may have forgotten,dismissed or never have known about Ministry as year after year these pioneers were cloned in various ways from pop to rock and then some but I as well as many other die hard fans have not.This new release is not so much a return to form as it is a band in the throes of overcoming-period.I love every inch of Ministry good and bad and have not stopped buying their cd's and never will as long as they continue to make theyre own music theyre way.Bands with this kind of work ethic and creative stamina are just non-exsistent in this day and age.Right on!Bring on another decade of Ministry!!!",116

I was disappointed that the words were not the same size (large) as my classmates book. Also, I found out that I needed to order Level 1 of this Spanish book. I really would like to return the book and get the Level 1 that I am using for my class, if that is possible. I would not have ordered this book had I known that the words were so small. If you can help me I really would appreciate. I paid at least $54.00 for this book with CDs. Thank you.Ms. Williams",118
1,Tease,"Good splatterpunk containing extremely relevant, current biotech issues, really only dealing with animal rights indirectly. Too bad that We3 only lasts three chapters -- just not quite enough to really explore the themes involved. As a result, a couple of moments Morrison resorts to almost offhand remarks that may come across as preachy and dismissive. While good, the length makes the overall effort seem hasty and leaves the reader desiring more perspectives. Above average artwork; worth reading once or twice.",80
0,It's only EZ chords,"No where does it say (save for the picture of the book) that this is the EZ version of the songs. All this is really good for is knowing the chord changes and keys of the songs, not fills, solos or runs. This book is great if you are just looking to strum along and sing, but not much else. I wish it would have been stated some place else what this was...",73

0,There's a reason why punk died...it was terrible,"I laugh every time I hear people proclaim this or that band as ""punk"". That ... music died a long time ago and people still want to milk it. Punk was about bad playing, bad singing, and statement making. The statement made was ""We Suck"". And just as so called ""punk"" bands before them the Hives fit that statement. The singing, if you can call it that is god aweful. The musicianship is non-existant. The length of the cd should tell you about the song craft. The amazing thing is that people are eating this ... up. So if you like garbage than by all means buy this. If you insist on proclaiming punk your music taste at least listen to the source like The Ramones, The Clash,..etc.",128

1,Excellent Choice,My father and I put this crib together in about 10 minutes. The assembly is extremly easy. The only bummer was the lever the lifts side up and down on one side was cracked. Its not a big deal we just super glued that one and won't use that side. The crib is so pretty and very sturdy. Everyone who has seen it has said they really like it alot and ask where I got it. I highly recommend it and the price is great as well.,87
0,Why is this a classic?,"I don't understand. I don't understand, why this has so many great reviews. I have read Frankenstein, I have read Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Hardy. Some of the best Victorian writers and I don't find this book to be that well written. I honestly have to say, I find it so excrutiatingly boring, dull, poorly written that I can't get past forty pages. Frankestein is great! I will die happy knowing that I have never read this hideously boring book!!!",79
0,Looking for another book!,I didn't log on to review this book but to search for another. I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. I haven't taken the exam yet because after going over and over this book I have no confidence that I can pass the exam. All the extra fluff was terribly distracting! I couldn't keep track of where he was going most of the time. I passed my MCSE self study in 4 months. So I don't think its just me. I going to try another author.,89
1,Great author,I have read all three of CJ West's books and they are fast moving thrillers. I know he has a fourth coming out and I can't wait to read it. I love thrillers and they have to hold my attention to keep me going. These books do just that and more. LOVE them.,53

0,blatant ignorance,"Catholic translations prior to Luther spoke of faith alone at Romans 3:28. Hence, the Nuremberg Bible of 1483 had ""allein durch den glauben,"" while the Italian Bibles of Geneva in 1476 and even 1538 had ""per sola fede."" Luther added the qualifier 'alone'. However, this was neither a complete innovation nor a real falsification, for the translation of the Bible that appeared in 1483 had rendered Galatians 2:16: ""justified only by faith"". Three Italian editions of Scripture (Genoa, 1476; Venice, 1583 and 1546) offered a similar translation. The author is clearly not qualified to give an accurate portrait of biblical historicity. As another reviewer commented, this book is typically appealing to the teenage level 'apologist'.",115

1,A valuable tool for deeper knowledge of first editions,"Bill McBride's other book, ""A Guide to the Identification of First Editions,"" shares the basic methods that individual publishers use for distinguishing first editions from later printings.This is a great companion to that volume. It's also by Bill McBride, and will help you delve much deeper into the finer details of first editions. It lists the ""points of issue"" -- these are the fine details (a typo, binding color, dustjacket detail) that may distinguish the first books printed in a first edition from later ones. Not every book has ""points of issue,"" but for many literary works which do, these differences can make a vast difference in value.It's small, inexpensive and easy to slip in your bag or pocket, perfect for book hunting trips. It's well organized, so upon opening it, you'll find it easy to find the necessary information quickly. Collectors and booksellers alike (I am both) of all experience levels will find it an invaluable tool.",158
1,Some really nice passages...,"Being always willing to give an industry oriented book a shot, I picked up this entertaining page turner with no preconcieved notions in my head. It was penned by Steven Bochco- the creative force behind TV shows like Hill St. Blues, NYPD Blue, and L.A. Law- and spins a windy tale about a blocked screenwriter, sexual escapades, money, and murder. While the writing is a bit predictable and sluggish at times, and the attempt to come across blunt and gritty just feels forced, its still a fun and entertaining read with a nice touch of dark humor. The narrative is engaging and the twists will make your brain smile. It reads like a decent movie script in need of an editor: fun and full of potential.",126
0,Foe Gillian Anderson completists only.,"With the exception of the always fantastic performance of Gillian Anderson, The X-Files Movie is a cobbled-together mish-mash of all the WORST aspects of the series: the convoluted conspiracy crap, Mulder's weak quips and Scully reduced to a damsel-in-distress. Pathetic.",40
1,As Real As It Gets...,"I had heard a lot about Kiki Swinson so I couldn't wait to get my hands on her first novel, Wifey and let me tell you...I was not disappointed. Wifey is as real as it gets when it comes to the wives and girlfriends of drug dealers. I admire Kiki for not glamorizing the hustler's life style and for keeping it real. An amazing writer, Kiki is definitely one to watch in the literary world!",75
0,Telling but Lacking,"While the book does explore the personal experiences of those suffering in pain adeptly, the author and contributors fail to include many sides of this complex issue of the way pain in our society is viewed and why it is so. I would say there is a limited scope at best. The book assumes for instance that addiction is a separate disease when in fact many patients in pain have co existing addiction problems past or present which clouds the issues inherent in prescribing opiates obviously. Further, there is growing acceptance currently for the theory that ""disease"" is a term applied to addiction too freely, apparently a trend not limited to outside of this book. Also I note a glaring lack of references. I recall seeing similar discourse and material discussed in several separate magazine articles and web blogs unrelated to this author, pre dating the publishing of this book. Not all original premises but certainly a valiant attempt to have an all inclusive resource.",165
0,"When they are good, they are very very good but when they go bad, they're horrid!!","I have purchased three of these units. When they work, they are WONDERFIUL. Problem is, they don't work well for long. My first unit worked beautifully for almost a year. I didn't hesitate replacing it with another unit. This one, however, only worked for about 3 months. I didn't have my purchase receipt for warranty repair so I bought yet one more. This time, the unit NEVER worked properly. Each time the unit failed (including the one I just received from Amazon), it was due to the rain guage losing contact with the main unit. Changing batteries, resetting, etc. etc. was to no avail (and VERY annoying because of all the silly little screws). I returned the last unit and will NOT purchase another Oregon Scientific wireless rain guage unless they explicitly address the loss of contact issue.",138
0,"Attractive, but not durable...","My husband received this ceramic crock as a gift two weeks ago. Last night as he went to lift it by the handle to move it, one of the knobs that the handle attaches to snapped off. We were disappointed but not ultimately suprised as this thing weighs quite a bit. The handle itself is heavy duty but the knobs used to attach it to the crock are just not beefy enough to support the weight of this thing. I called Plow and Hearth and they are giving a full refund to the gift-giver and I am pleased with how they responded.If you want something pretty to keep your scraps in, this is great, just don't pick it up by the handle.",122
0,Decent Camera for the Novice User,"I got this camera as a Christmas present in 2005 and it's been decent for me for the 2-3 years I've had it.pros:- Easy to Use...pretty much point and click with a no-hassle menu- Cheap/Affordablecons:- The flash is just not very intuitive and I've began turning off the flash because it wears thin on me at social gatherings in dark spots.- Horrible Battery Life...I took this camera on a 2 week trip to Italy and had to insert a pair of Double A batteries every other day (I only took 400-500 shots). The problem is the power usage of the digital screen on the back of the camera. Once that's turned off, the battery life extends to 1-2 weeks sometimes under the same usage as my time in Italy.- A little bit too blocky for users that want something slim.Overall, it's an ok starter camera, but for someone that expects to use a camera quite often, I suggest trying something else.",161
0,Poor Ticking,I got these about a year ago for a gift. They were quite firm but I figured they would break-in after using them for a while. I put them in pillow protectors before using them.

I really wanted a good set of down pillow and this just isn't it.,89
1,How To Use Friends and Step All Over Them...,"Firstly, I am appalled at the number of reviewers -myself included- who have given this book 5 stars.

0,"I just found out yesterday that ""Plow"" wasn't by Mike Ness of Social Distortion","When someone buys a full-length album, and grumbles about how it only has one good song on it, this disc is the kind of album they're talking about.Sponge is a fitting name for this band; they absorb and concentrate all their good music into one song. And I swear to God, I actually thought ""Plowed"" was a Social Distortion song until I saw the music video on VH-1 (literally) yesterday for it. No wonder I couldn't figure out why Mike Ness was singing over a power pop ballad. It was an impersonator.I give this album half a star for one good song. It would've gotten a full five stars had ""Plow"" actually been from Social D on an album surrounded by equally-good Social D songs.",125
1,Thin and tough reflective tape.,"This reflective tape is ultra thin and the adhesive is very good, sticking to smooth and matte finishes well. It is easy to apply and the results look sharp. The reflectivity is on par with road signs (if that's a good comparison). The only knock against it is that the tape isn't 100% consistent in thickness and some of the edges weren't smooth, but that got better further along in the roll.",72
0,A disappointment,"Unfortunately, this book did not live up to its fascinating premise (time travel through wormholes) and the ""teaser"" synopsis on the back cover. It begins well, and the first 90 pages are excellent hard sci-fi. The book quickly degenerates into a poorly disguised pulpit for radical ""environmentalism"", however, with the hero discovering a model to unfailingly predict catastrophic environmental degradation. The essence of this story is that climate models are always right, and the empiricists are always wrong. The novel contains profound elements of eco-conservatism and a lot of poor science. Among other things, apparently the author didn't know that algae was a plant, and produced oxygen. In sum, I strongly recommend avoiding this book.",115
1,A real page burner!,"Find out if an emigré Russian mobster turned his wife & home to shishlik for the insurance money. Well worth the read, and one of the best examples of what life is sometimes like for an over achieving insurance adjuster. True in many respects especially the details. Gives respectability to a field that most people only encounter by accident and often come away from that experience with a negative opinion. A negative is one thing this book isn't!",78
1,Great upgrade to E2C or any other entry level canalphone!,"I bought these because I found my previous phones, the E2Cs rather annoying to keep in my ear and also because I felt like an upgrade. If you're more of a bass-head, I'd still recommend the E2C. The E4s bass is slightly better defined but just a tad less deep...and I really mean a tad.Overall sound quality is as good as the very MANY online reviews say it is. Not best of class but very musical. If you are listening to music for pleasure (not work), musicality is a good thing. Slightly exaggerated mids clarity and moderately extended (in duration not depth) bass are some of the embellishments.Overall a good buy for the price (175 USD) and it's a good 70 USD cheaper than all the stores in Singapore.Kudos to Shure and Amazon.com!",133
1,Lots of information,"This is a good book for entry level open water swimmers. The specific information on swimming in the open water is very good and useful. However, as a professional swim coach, I noticed a large part of the advice on how to swim the freestyle (front crawl) stroke is simply outdated. If you disregard the parts on how to swim freestyle (and instead find a coach to work with you), this book is very, very informative.",76
0,Terrible mystery wrapped around fascinating facts,"Brown constructs a 3rd rate mystery to carry a boatload of amazingly interesting facts about the early origins of Christianity and the Holy Grail. I wish he would've just written a book on the substance and spared the extremely amateurish and poor writing. I was also irritated to see how much he ripped off ""Foucault's Pendulum"" by Umberto Eco, which was light years ahead of this extremely disappointing book. If you're a fan of fine writing in mysteries, like Alan Furst, you'll be very disappointed in the Da Vinci Code.",90

When it was fun, interesting, had actual charactors instead of sexual organs that walk and talk.I am deeply disappointed in this book, and revolted. Not because of the sex but because it wasn't sex. It was as though she thought of the most offensive, unlikable sexual situations gaurenteed to offend, and wrote those down.I'm ashamed I even read the whole thing. That I wasted that time and effort.

Since Science & Health is typically referenced for study by page and line number, plus liner notes in the columns, it's almost impossible to use this version for study.

After we received this, she did some research and found that it is actually worth more than is being charged on Amazon (if you find the right collector, of course). She says it is the closest example of what she has read so far in the comics - she has other figures in different sizes that are not what she considers ""authentic"" Deadpool figures. To her, this item was definitely worth the money, and is a good investment to boot.",115
1,Great Science Show for Kids!,"My son (2.5) loves this DVD. He acts along with the skits and now has a very basic understanding of the forces of motion (force, friction, inertia, and elasticity). Because of this dvd, when he falls or hurts himself, we can discuss what happened and when he realizes there was ""too little friction between his socks and the floor"", he gets excited about knowing what happened and is no longer upset.We bought a 5-pack of Sid DVDs on Woot.com and can't wait to give them to him. As much as I like this particular DVD, I am getting a bit tired of it. I do feel there's a great re-watch-ability to the Sid shows:)",114
1,A Pleasure to Drain!,"Just received this pool for my 6 year old son and we absolutely love it! The floor of the pool inflates which is a big plus right there, as it makes draining the pool sooooooo easy. I used to wrestle with the old pool from last year, every night - it took me a good 30 mins to drain the big rectangle monster, had to prop end of pool to get water out and then start bailing with a bucket. NOT this pool - you just pull the floor plug and all the water drains by itself. My son enjoys this pool as well - just getting in to cool off with all of his pool toys - he has a grand old time. Great pool for kids and easy maintenance for parents.",133
1,Corvette: A Buyers Guide,"Given the small size of the book the detail is excellent and accurate. The book was published in black and white (including illustrations) which limited the identification of Corvette models. For example, the corvette Anniversary model in the 1980's has body colored alloys and a different sort of pillar on the door.The book is very useful if you are wanting to purchase a corvette as it has engine numbers, colours and all details from that date so that you know all the real details of the car.Perhaps the next addition will have colored pictures, considering that most aspects of a car are viewed and it is important to identify the subtle details of a vehicle, especially special features (ie. anniversary cars).",121

Simple Kid combines a very original mix of electronics, acoustic/electric guitars, and a somewhat vintage feel to create these 11 awesome sounding tracks. Songs such as ""Truck On"" and ""Kids don't care"" offer a break from your typical ""made for MTV"" music. I DEFINATELY recommend them.",60
1,I Love this movie!,"I love this movie! I expected a lot of things from this movie when I first picked it up and originality was not one of them. Words cannot tell you how happy I was after watching this film. It's got everything fantasy films these days are lacking; wit, sophistication, adventure, and actors who can actually give their characters depth. Its a wonderful story that leaves you wanting more. Stardust makes me wish that more film makers had the guts to step away from their tried and true Hollywood formulas and try something thats decidedly ""out of the box."" Buy it, you won't regret it.",104

0,too many things to go wrong: buy a CORDED or gas model,"First the string didn't release when tapping as hoped. Then the 2nd spool wouldn't even feed out by hand, you have to unscrew it and unwind it every time it needs more string. The spring that goes with the spool gets lost, too, making this necessary.Then if you don't keep it charging, or the ac/dc charger wire gets cut and the trimmer doesn't get charge, it won't recharge. So you then have to replace the charger (if cut) for $30 and/or the lead acid battery (old technology and makes item heavier), for $??Just get a corded model or gas powered.",100
0,Boring and Irritating!,"This was a very tough book to get through. The first 1/3 of the book was interesting and seemed promising, and then...it just got so awful.There was no plot thickening except at the very beginning and the very end of the book (complete with plot holes!). Throughout the rest of the book, was just a bunch of nonsense to show how bad the bad guys really were and how good the good guys were. At least throw in a couple more plot twists while you're at it.The personal side of the story with the 10 kids and the sick wife was sweet at first, but it was so excessive and sugary it became annoying.The crime is solved mostly by accident. I was hoping SOMEONE (FBI, NYPD, anybody!) would actually use their noggin and make some connections through deductive reasoning, rather than continuing to rely on failed hostage negotiations.",148
1,BR Bluray Review,"After the Korean copy of the Battle Royale Special Edition, it was refreshing to see the subtitles in sync with the actors and the dialogue making sense! The picture and sound quality was excellent along with the supplements. To have the original and Director's cut along with BR II (not the best sequel around, but watchable) is a big plus! I have only one gripe, although minor, they should not have bothered making a dubbed track of the movie. It was so horrible, it makes the old Godzilla and Gamera voice overs look like they were directed by Kenneth Brannagh! That fact aside, I think you win big with this special edition bluray of Battle Royale!",116
0,They can slide on the carpet,"The chair risers are advertised as ""nonskid"" but they can slide on carpet. Bought these for my elderly father who had hip surgery. His chair is in the middle of the room and when he sat down or stood up the chair slid. He uses a walker so it is dangerous for the furniture to move. Also, I did not think the depression at the top of the cone is as deep as it was described. Probably if the chair backed up to a wall or you don't need a walker they would be OK. Even though I had used them the Stander Company said to return them. I bought them through Amazon and the return process was very easy through Amazon.",122

0,Don't buy this - Save $50 and get the Airhogs Havoc. It's EXACTLY the same,"So, I put both this and the Airhogs Havoc on my wishlist for a recent birthday and actually received both of them. I was looking forward to seeing what the difference was that would warrant a $50 difference in price.Well they're both here and they are the same toy from the same manufacturer. They are in the same packaging with the same remote and the same stickers.I don't intend this to be a negative review of the product, as I'm 34 years old and haven't had this much fun with a toy since I was 12. It flies great and is completely addictive.Having said that, it's exactly the same as the Havoc. I even took my Havoc's controller, switched it to the appropriate channel, and it controlled the Picco Z perfectly.I absolutely recommend the helicopter..... just save the $50 and get the Havoc.Good luck!",144

0,Jewel is officially a SELLOUT,"This CD is HORRIBLE. It is, by far, the worst CD I have ever purchased. I used to respect Jewel for her earlier works which seperated her from the rest of the cookie cutter pop princesses. Now shes desperately trying to cater to a whole new croud with poppy britney-spears-like songs through the use of her new-founded, blatent sexuality. The only catchy song on this CD is ""Intuition"" and it gets old quickly. Sure, for those who have seen the ""Intuition"" music video, Jewel is making fun of capitalism and advertising agencies who use sex and fame to sell products. But how does she explain turning around and selling that very song to Gillette to promote their new shaving product for women??? Now all we see of Jewel is a 40-year-old women clathed in mini skirts and barely-there bra tops trying to stake a claim in a Britney Spears' market. This CD is horrible. I ALMOST can't blame her for using sex to sell this one.",166

0,"Lots of text, lots of errors","I read the 3rd edition of this book in preparation for the Java programmers exam - its an old version, but I read it since a colleague had it handy. There's a lot of information in this book, but too much of it is incorrect for my liking. In some sections there are serious errors on nearly every page. If it was a 1st edition book it might be understandable, but how can a book like this get to its third edition with so many mistakes? If you're an experienced Java programmer, you'll probably just laugh at the errors (as I did), but if you really want a book to learn Java to pass the exam, then I suggest you try another one - this book will only confuse you and make things worse.",134

1,An Outsider's Perspective On Hardcore...,"Nowadays, when kids hear the term ""hardcore"" thrown around, they toss around names like Underoath or even worse, Atreyu; these sorts of bands have watered down the hardcore concept to appeal to the larger emo-kid crowd. Raised Fist's newest disc, Sound of the Republic, lends a European's perspective on the changing scene. The Swedish quartet's first album in four years proves to be a worthy sucessor to 2002's Dedication, which reminded us all what hardcore is all about - speed, ferocity, and social awareness. This time around, you can feel more of a metal influence, which only re-enforces their tenacious song writing skills. Most importantly, though, SOTR revives the spirit of old-school hardcore, bands like Sick of It All and Agnostic Front, to remind us that this ""emo-hardcore"" phase is nothing but a passing fad.",135

1,Good purchase for the money,"I reviewed strollers, like other mothers, for a few weeks before I decided on this one. I wanted a cheap and well designed stroller for my toddler. We got to the zoo and in airports and malls a lot!!! I like this stroller for almost every reason. It has a really cute look and comfy padding for my son. It folds rather small and quite easily. It's light. My only issues were this: I wish it had a carring srap(it's kinda akward to hold in any such way), the visor could provide better sun coverage(the weather shield would be good to come with it or buy after), and the strap between the legs is just to far back. The part where it meets the fabric to keep it in place is too far back and makes it uncomfordable for an older child. I just took the strap out from the seat and made it a 4-point harness instead. Overall my son loves it. It has bright blue and meets all my needs. The cross bar in the basket doesn't interfear in any way!",183
1,"Sophisticated Soul, Indeed!","This album (pardon me, cd!) is one of the priceless ""undiscovered jewels"" in the Motown treasure chest! Wanda Rogers' husky, breathy, sexy vocals are brilliant; even more so when you consider that she and Smokey created this album without much help from the Motown higher echelon (which was more attuned to making Miss Ross a movie star at this point).Ann Bogan (the last Motown hired Marvelette), rivals Wanda with a powerfull performance of her own.Along with ""The Return of the Marvelettes"" (another wonderful Wanda-Smokey project unpromoted into obscurity), Sophisticated Soul is one of the BEST examples of the famed Motown Sound.

It just will NOT keep a sharp edge and getting one on it is no trivial effort if even possible. I have 3 steels, a knife sharpening stone block, a Chef's Choice electrical sharpener and they all, to a tee, cannot get an edge on this crazy knife. God knows I've tried. I know my knives too because I own 3 Globals, 2 Wustoffs, 2 Shun Pros and several Calphalon knives - which I think certain Calphalon knives are far, far better. It's not always the co$t of an item.

I read the book twice and highlighted the most important points the second time around. In three and a half months, I have realized profits of $44,176 and unrealized net gains of $7,509.

0,Not Historical Fiction,"This book was recommended to me as ""historical fiction"". Fiction is a perfect description, but historical is but a loose term used to describe this book. The few chapters I could tolerate were well written, however, I felt deceived in that the book was described as historical fiction, and I expect with historical fiction that the story is based mostly on fact. As far as I know, there was no place called ""The Fair Isle"" where women lived as ""witches"", in this time period or any other. That is the stuff of Arthurian Legend, and I was not under the impression that this work of ""historical fiction"" had legend and lore included in it. I don't mean to nit pick, but I was expecting a work of fiction based on fact, not legend. If you are looking for a good novel based on fact, try Sharan Newman, Sharon Kay Penman or Ken Follet.",153

1,Working For The Nazi's,"The book ""The Holocaust Survivors"" is mainly about how interviewers ask some of the survivors what it was like to be in the Holocaust. Many of the survivors said that it was very tragic to see some of their family members being shot, for some unknown reason or dieing, or from starvation. I thought this book was a great book on the Holocaust during World War II. The book also taught me more facts on what happened to the survivors. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn more about the Holocaust.",95

1,Inexplicably underrated--one of their best,"Routinely named as the Beatles' worst album, this is in fact one of my favorites, and I believe one of their best. The Beatles put aside the sound of their first three albums and instead go for a sort of country-rock sound, a few years before Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, and Dylan do it. How can you go wrong with an album that includes ""No Reply"", ""I'm A Loser"", ""Eight Days A Week"", ""I Don't Want To Spoil The Party"" and ""What You're Doing""? The covers are more numerous and not as good as on other albums, perhaps, but hey, ""Rock and Roll Music"" and ""Words Of Love"" do it for me. Give this album a chance!",117

It really amazed me how great of a sound was produced out of these microphones!The SM 57's also work great with amps and insturments.The Beta-52 provides a great punch as well.The only complaint i have are the clips. They hook on to boom cymbal stands as well as drums, but they are hard to position on drums. If put on a cymbal stand, the mic rattles a little in the recording.Other than that, these mics are awesome.

Most knife sets come with black handles and I did not want that look. These knives are beautiful and cut through most everything with ease. I am thrilled with my purchase and I felt that the price of these knives were comparable to other name brands. We were also impressed because the knives are made in Germany of forged steel, all one piece. What a great Christmas gift with all the holiday cooking we did!!",94
1,Good stainless canning set,"I already have the red plastic canning kit - this is a great upgrade. It's a good and very complete canning set. The stainless steel is easier to clean and sterilize. Love the funnel with its filter insert. I love the lid holder. And the added natural cheesecloth was great, too. Like the other reviewer stated, the canning rack is huge. You'd need a full-sized pot to make it work, so if you're getting this what that item in mind, be aware.",82

1,Navigator stands out now!,"This grill is awesome! My Navigator went from plain to chromed out with this sucker! It is super easy to install. Only issue is it is flat and most grill front aren't so it wings up some on the sides especially the bottom part, I can't crank it down tighter for fear I will break the original grill up but you don't notice it unless you are close up. Also, my hood no longer stays up on it's own because of the weight of this. I have had no over heating issues, the temp gauge showed no hotter than without it. I am so happy I bought this!",108
1,Just as good as before.,"I haven't seen this movie in over 12 years and bought it to replace the VHS version I previously owned as well as watch it with my husband who had not previously seen it. Although I had viewed it several times in the past and remembered many lines by heart, it was just as good as I remembered it! I am happy to add it to our collection!",68
0,"ugh, another disappointing big snake movie!","Python is probably one of the worst ""attack of the killer snake"" type movies ever. The biggest problem I had is that after an hour, only ONE appearance by the gigantic king-size snake occurs! The rest of that time is occupied with crappy and irrelevant dialogue mainly involving pointless chit chat between members of the police department. When I say pointless I really mean it- you won't care about anything they have to say at *all*, I promise. At least the last 30 minutes are saved thanks to the killer snake slithering through an underground facility, chasing teens and killing them one by one. This is the reason the movie gets 2 stars out of me. Everything else about the movie is forgettable, boring and excessively dialogue-heavy.",127
1,One breathtaking video,"As a wildlife researcher for over 17 years I spent many hours in the field working specifically with wood warblers. I can say with confidence that this is the most breathtaking footage on North American warblers I have ever seen. With close-up gorgeous photography and audio that gives you the feeling that you are right in the the field yourself, this video should not be missed. I have literally watched this video dozens of times and still have not grown tired of it. Even if you are a beginner to the facinating sport of birding you are bound to be captivated at the close-up views and beautiful songs of these ""butterflies of the bird world"".",115
0,Not so much,"The author is incredibly talented and relates her traumatic experiences in a matter-of-fact manner that makes this book incredibly disturbing. In truth, I could not read more than the first three chapters or so because it was so painful to learn of her experiences.

0,It's sad when good authors aren't edited,"Oh Chris Bojhalian, your fans must mourn! A good idea, a well-set up plot, but why did you let them rush you to publication? Three-quarters of this book reads like a first draft - overwritten, with more extraneous ideas crammed into a sentence than it needs in a whole page. Explaining the same things over and over, not as drama building hints, but disrespecting your readers' intelligence. We can make the connections ourselves, we can remember what you wrote last chapter. I am sorry I paid money for this book - sorry it is taking up space in my house. If only it had been edited it might actually have been enjoyable to read!",114
0,Delonghi DCM485 Thermal Coffee Maker,"First let me state that this coffee maker makes the best cup of coffee I have ever had. Now for the cons. I bought mine from ebay at a good price. The first one lasted about 2 months before it went dead. Push the brew button twice and nothing happens. Kept trying, unpluged, let set, waited 24hrs hoping it would reset. Not so, and I tossed it in the garbage and went to ebay and bought another at a good price. By the way both were used. Anyway plugged the seconed one in and it was loaded with scale. So I run two cycles with vinigar as stated in the manual. Water was clean so I proceeded to brew a pot of coffee. Guess what, dead. Would not start to brew. I have emailed the company 2 times with no answere. In the meantime I had purchased new set of filters for around $30, so I had a pretty good investment so far. I am still waiting for a reponce from my emails. I still like the features of this model and if ou can get it cheap enough, try it out. Good luck.",194

I have an undergad in English and worked as a writer/editor for a magazine for a number of years, and yet this book taught me things that I had never learned elsewhere.

0,"Good suction but Cheap, Breakable plastic","Have had my DC-07 for 2 1/2 years. I am satisfied with the vacuum but completely dissatisfied with the plastic unit. The handle cracked. I barely used the handle since I felt it wasn't strong enough to move such a heavy unit around. Of course even with the little use, it did crack and the company is charging $60 (10% of the unit value) to replace something that never should have been used in the 1st place, since it was out of warranty.In addition, the plastic attachment that holds the extender cracked.I should have followed the leads from others that wrote of similar problems. I invested in this unit thinking it would last me at least 10 years. With the breaks and the cracks, it will barely get through 3.",130
1,Enjoyed this book,I enjoyed reading this book. There were many suggestions to promoting a web site - some of which I followed. One big mistake I made was using a list from Imediafax. I agree with the previous writer. Their data is way out of date. The most valuable information I learned is how to properly write a press release. This book shows you step-by-step how to create a press release and e-mail it out. I had a lot of success with mine.,81
1,A Unique & Disturbing Film,"This film got a good share of publicity when it was released. The story certainly was different. After a lot of people watched the film and the subseqent VHS, I noticed a lot of people annoyed at Jodie Foster's character in the movie, a woman who uttered constantly incoherent phrases. It became aggravating to some. I didn't find that on the first viewing but I admit, it did on the second and third.The point is, if you haven't the film, check it out, but it may not be one you'd want to see multiple times. Then again.......Liam Neeson played a no-nonsense good guy. His wife, Natasha Richardson, who tragically died just a week ago, also adds to this unique story. I don't want to say more in fear of spoiling the story, but kudos to Foster for an outstanding effort. It's a movie you won't forget.",146
1,A Real Treasure,"If you love the Blues or, as I do, play the Blues this DVD is a real treasure. That treasure comes from the old film clips of the Blues Masters in their prime, the ""insider"" stories and of course the story of the dedication and generosity of Clifford Antone.",49

1,Silver is a great live album,"Having not been a fan of live albums this one is an exception.Cheap Trick put together a 2 cd album from their tours.Although in their 50's they still sound good.Rick insists on telling the audience that Robin sounds better singing.This album brings both John Bryant and its nice to hear Tom Peterson playing his 12 string bass.Over all the hits are here from surrender to Dream Police.They even threw in Woke Up With A Monster in there.The one balad that gave me goose bumps was called Time Will Let You Know.The ending chorus was lifting.There are a few tracks that I skipped just because I never really cared for them anyway.Gonna Raise Hell off the Dream Police album,Woke up with a Monster and the dreadfull version of I'm Losing You. Robin let John Lennon handle that one friend no ofense.Over all Cheap Trick fans won't be disapointed.Just remember its not Live at Budakan and you'll be alright.",157
1,FANTASTIC!,"I recently went out of town on business and stayed in a small hotel. While typing on my notebook PC I turned on the TV for some company and found myself watching some obscure cable channel with some singers on there. Not initially paying too much attention, I was soon drawn away from my work because I heard some incredible vocals coming from the television. As I continued to watch more intently, I was moved to tears, praise and joy as I witnessed Avalon singing live! I had never heard of Avalon before, and I realize now that I've been missing something special! Their ministry is powerful and the sincerity of their performance is a blessing. The song ""Can't Live A Day"" especially touched my heart. From one singer to another.....Sing on Avalon, sing on!",135
0,Didn't even finish this book,"I read his first book ""The Dossier"" and didn't think much of that book, but was hoping this one would be better. I decided to not even finish the book, the writing just wasn't that great and the story line wasn't interesting.I wouldn't recommend it.",45
0,Just pass on this one,"I chose this item because Amazon offered free shipping. Don't do it.The screws pop out, the holes are not drilled properly. The finish is uneven and it is VERY UNSTABLE. Woobley! The last thing you would like is your furniture to fall on your child!The back panels are almost cardboard thin and don't meet! In other words, there is a crack in the back of the armoire that is a half inch wide and you see your wall! The interior is WHITE ... which if fine for a white piece but mine was wood (faux wood) in color.It's a piece of junk. I would try another brand. It's not worth the time and effort to return, its heavy to ship back.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.",129
1,Barbra brings back Christmas Memories,"When I first listened to this CD I was impressed by the voice as all ways but did not care for the fact that many of the songs were not classic christmas songs. However after listening to it again a saw the beautiful melodies in songs like ""closer"" and ""christmas lulliby"". I love that the CD has ""It must have been the mistletoe"" and ""my grown-up christmas list"". I rarely hear these songs but they are some of my favorites. My only compaint is that the CD is almost all slow songs. I wish there were more faster ones like ""it must have been the mistletoe"". But all in all it is another wonderful present from Barbra to the world.",120

1,HISTORY,"All these old films from the 30's and 40's, WOW. It's like I struck gold. And at such a modest price? Hours of viewing pleasure. Sometimes the acting is primitive. But, then again, I've watched so called 'Hollywood' films of that era and found them to be primitive. So what.",50
1,VERY GOOD BOOK BUT WHERE IS THE D*MN SEQUEL!?,"A very good read, but also very frustrating. If this book was written in '95-96, why has it taken so long to write a sequel?",25
1,Music Fan Must,I saw a clip of the Video on a target commercial back in December and have been on a quest to find the CD ever since. I had to go to four Target Stores before I found the CD and I must say I wasn't disappointed. The entire CD is exceptional from start to finish. I was hoping for at least three good tunes and was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed all the songs. Bob has an amazing voice! If you like NickelBack or Matchbox Twenty you will LOVE his music! I say definitely give it a listen and Target.....do a better job of keeping it stocked!!!,107
1,Dexter Gordon mesmerizes with his music and his acting,"For a non-actor musician, Dexter can show a lot of A-list actors a thing or two. Unlike Hollywood movies featuring a well-known jazz musician, this one delivers the real thing, music-wise, with no fading the music and cutting to the main characters dining and talking. But the writing is a little tedious at times, making the actors say some corny, self-conscious lines, as if explaining and talking down to an audience that's never heard any jazz before. Dexter's character, Dale Turner the celebrated tenor sax player and alcoholic, is subjected to some unnecessary humiliation to sledge-hammer home the message that if he goes back to the bottle, it's curtains for him. And some silly, unreal and unnecessary minor characters, added merely for color. However, the movie is satisfying as the story of one American jazz musician among the many that were drawn to Paris, where nobody noticed the color of their skin.",152
1,Hilarious sequel to another great book,This old book still holds up very well as a hilarious take-off on the comparison between the trip to the Contient between an avant-garde like Auntie Mame and a bunch of nouveaux-riches snobs that she encounters. Still hilarious after all these years and nonetheless more relevant with appropriate historical references that make it ring more true. Very funny book.,59
1,Great punky geeky rocker,"I FINALLY got this CD many years after it's release, and I loved it. This really brought back memories of the new wave-punk of the seventies and eighties, and this CD was executed with all the passion and intensity of the times - with no 90's waffling or overproduced [stuff]... that permeated so many similar sounding bands of the time.Give these 'weezers' a try if you are still a fan of the power-punk-pop thing of the late 70's early 80's (my high school daze). If you were never a fan of this kind of thing, or willing to give the 'pop-punk' thing a go, this is the one!",108
1,DLO remote for IPOD,"I love my DLO Homedock Music remote. I paid over $100 for my 1st one at Best Buy. It lasted 2 1/2 years. Since the battery can't be replaced, when it died I bought this one for $48 from Amazon. The display lists the playlists artists and songs. I teach Zumba and Yoga and the volume cotrol and ability to switch songs is awesome. works from over 100 feet from the IPOD. I haven't exceeded the 50 playlist capacity since I delete the really old lists.",86
1,Does not have Subtitles,This is a cute holiday movie. I appreciated the way they worked Christ into Christmas with Santa. But one correction needs to be made in the product details. This DVD has caption not subtitles as is stated. That means you can play it on a DVD player and get caption but you can not get caption or subtitles on a blu-ray player with this product.,65
1,Truly Excellent,"This book serves as an outstanding aid to students trying to master the law. The author keeps his focus on the true goals for the law student: success on exams, bar passage, and preparation for a satisfying career. He offers clever and clearly described means toward those ends by breaking down all the skills a successful lawyer (and law student) must master. The book appeals to students with different learning styles, is witty, and is written in a manner that both the novice and expert can appreciate. In short, it's a fantastic and essential companion for all law students.",99
1,Richard Miller Rocks,"I read Mosca in two sittings with Leonard Cohen's The Future playing in the background. Misanthropy magnified.It's about, like all of Miller's books in one way or another, facing up to the inevitability of our eventual self destruction... maybe I should say apparant inevitability for although there is a fatalistic feeling there is also an undercurrent of potential salvation. Even if it doesn't always go that way there's a feeling that maybe if something was done a little earlier... But anyway fantastically written, It reads to me like human thought on paper... but able to be followed (this is no finnegan's wake) excellent employment of zeugma.",106
1,It IS the Bible,"This is the best book of its kind out there. No exceptions. If you a working film professional, you can't be without it. There is an extraordinary amount of information in it.

1,Love the Cuisinart,"I have two of these and love the convenience and features. My husband and I love to cook and there are just some things you can't do without. My first Cuisinart is 20 years old and still works great. I bought the second for a lake house and although it is a bit smaller, it does everything you would expect. The cleanup is easy and they last forever.I highly recommend the Cuisinart!",72
1,"Good charcters, Great Casting and good action sequences with a story about the winning spirit","James Earl Jones hands down one of his better choices playing the role of the Team USA coach in this movie about the International Karate Championships. Your character was creepy, the tone of that movie was unsettling in a bad way, and the lion cloth should never be cut that short on Ah-nold.Back to this movie, this is one my favorites because of the character development and storylines each charcter has throughout the movie. The Best of the Best has a dynamic cast, the late Chris Penn and a young Eric Roberts. This can stand as one of my favorite sports movies, like MIRACLE starring Kurt Russell about the US Olympic hockey them from the 70's that beat Russia.The story can be predictable and cheesy but there are heartfelt moments at the end of this long journey to the top.",140
0,Nothing new!,How disappointed I was when I heard this CD and realized that Lisa made her first album another time.Nothing new here. It almost sounds like left-overs from her previous album.The track that features Pink is nice but all the songs look the same. She'd better do like her father and let talented songwriters write for her. She has a great voice but I think she hasn't found her style yet. This album sounds too much like a Sheryl Crow-meets-Alanis Morrissette album.I'm sorry to say all this but I had great expectations when she released her first album. So now with this second album...I'm sure she can do better than that. It's in the genes.,114
0,Think twice before buying Wusthof over Henckels & Forschner,I have owned Henckels knives for years and when they get dull they are very easy to sharpen to a razor sharp edge by one's self. But with Wusthof knives I never seem to be able to get them as sharp like a Henckels Knife(and plus the factory edge on Henckels is much sharper than Wusthof). I would definite think twice about about how easy it is to sharpen a knife before buying it and Wusthof is very difficult while Henckels and Forschner are very very easy.,87
1,Roger Rabbit,When I was little I really loved this movie I used to have the roger rabbit doll where you pull the string in the back and the doll talked. I still have the movie on VHS and watch it occasionally every now and then I just don't have the doll anymore but excellent movie very good. 2 thumbs up. If you like Roger Rabbit then get this movie in dvd better quality of the picture I think but if your old school then go for VHS.,86
1,Underrated,This movie was actually pretty good. The brother of the psychotic Santa suit wearing killer goes loco and goes to a mental institution and escapes and kills people. The flashbacks were also very good and I especially enjoyed where he stuck the umbrella through the guy and then opened it.,50

0,This could be the last Cornwell book I'll ever read.,"This is one of the most depressing works of fiction that I have ever read. I can't believe how the characters I loved and the complicated stories I couldn't wait for from year to year have deteriorated so terribly. It was dark in the way a deserted coal mine on the darkest night of winter is dark. It is as sad and depressing as ... I can't even think of an image that is sad and depressing enough. I grieve for the Kay Scarpetta I knew and loved. I grieve for Lucy and Morino and even, to a small extent, Benton. If they were real people that I met somewhere, I'd make a point to avoid them in real life, which is what I will do to Cornwell's books until someone else who has read them tells me that the smart, savvy and entertaining characters I knew and loved are getting their lives and act together again.",157
1,SUPERB AND IDIOMATIC MUSICIANSHIP,"January 1st, 2006Every New Year's Day when I view this superb DVD of the VPO and Karajan at their most musicianly ways, I am impressed by the ebb, flow, and hesitancy which is the way the music of the Strausses should be played.A conductor friend of mine who studied in Vienna and was conductor of an orchestra in Lvov said that Karajan and the VPO in this recording got it RIGHT!Especially entrancing is the music accompanying the horses from the Spanish Riding School and Karjan's darling, Kathleen Battle, doing a fine rendition of the Voices of Spring.The stage is sumptuously decked out in what seem to be all of the fresh flowers in Vienna and one gets the sense that this was a real event because the maestro died only two years later.I highly recommend this DVD and it will give YOUR New Year's Day something special to remember it by.Timothy Wingate OTTAWA CANADA",154

There is no way you can badmouth the storyline and the cinematic movies and i have to say that this game is good enough to challenge Final Fantasy 7 as One of the best RPG's ever made. Seeing how other Sony RPG were so disappointing, Sony reedemed theirselves with this powerful Four disk adventure. It is game worth checking out.",85

1,Very Nice Indeed,"Like one of the other reviewers I picked up Brigette's first CD because I was familiar w/ her mom (Quincy Jones'version of My Cherie Amour). The CD was $2 bucks on the clearance shelf. The first CD is very good also, this one is better or more mature. Ithink she offers more emotional control over her songs than the current generation of pop divas. I think you'll be able to genuinely enjoy this CD ten years from now, as opposed to a lot of other pop CD where ten years from now you'll only listen to the hit track for nostaglia sake.",102
0,"James Markus, you are a dolt","John Updike is NOT Nabokov's equal in any sense, let alone in the realm of the metaphysical novel, in which Nabokov is and will forever remain God. Updike, unlike Nabokov, is constantly begging the reader to pity his nasty, dull protagonists. Everything seems to go right for them, despite their best efforts to fail and feel sorry for themselves, yet we're expected to cheer them allong and cry for them when they experience minor setbacks? No thanks. Nabokov's multi-layored gems offer no easy heroes and no simple-minded moral messages. That said, I think Updike can be really good. The Centaur is a wonderfull book, and some of his short fiction is great. His serially-destributed fiction is, however, far to long-winded and thick-headed and self-serving to be compared to anything by Nabokov. If Nabokov has an American successor, it's Pynchon or Barth, not Updike.",143

I own one which I bought over a year ago, and just bought another one for a friend. There have been a couple of changes in the design since I bought my first one. I find the new one slighly more demanding - you have to pay more attention to what you are doing - but it's great for making espresso and cappuccino at home. I make my own almond milk which steams/frothes perfectly. The investment practically pays for itself within a couple of months if you stop buying your latte etc. and make it at home.",113

I am sad to say that I was disappointed. I loved Kit from the very beginning of the books, and I still love him in this one, however it is the female lead that disappoints me. I'm used to strong leads, or at least ones that grow some sort of back bone so that they compliment their partners, in this book she didn't even come close to doing so, acting differently than a miss when they were in danger. Otherwise, she spent her time bemoaning her death, which admittedly gets tiresome. I don't know, the storie killed my enthusiasm for the book, as did Kit's almost imidiate love for her. It's a sweet story, don't get me wrong, but it's too sweet for me.",147
1,Edge-of-your-seat...,"When I was in high school, a friend of mine recommended ""Not Without My Daughter."" Twenty years later, I finally got around to reading it. I wish that friend were still in my life to discuss the book with. I recall her saying she stayed up all night, unable to put the book down, and I had much the same reaction. It is a riveting tale of domestic abuse and a harrowing escape, occuring in Tehran in 1984. Yes, there were moments that made me squirm because Betty Mahmoody seemed like a spoiled American making sweeping generalizations about a culture she had little time to experience, but the story overall is a compelling one.I recommend the book highly, with reservations. I also read ""Persepolis"" recently and that provided a much needed counterpoint to Mahmoody's biases. It is essential to consider more than one person's experiences. Not everyone in Iran is like the family she married into. That said, this is a compelling story and one worth knowing about.",168
1,Works smoothly and easy to install,Works very smoothly and easy to use because of the longish handle on the reel. Some have a big knob that's hard for my wife to grasp. I also like how easy it is to remove the reel so I can take it inside in freezing weather. Contained all parts except I needed plastic anchors to install in brick so I had to provide them. I'm replacing an older Suncast that held up pretty well for 5-6 years which is okay considering the heavy duty hose I had on it. I put a medium duty hose on this on for less weight. Makes it a lot easier to use and less strain on it.,114
0,Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince,It was a good book because it has suspence and Rowling is not afraid to let some characters go like Dumbledore! I've read all of the books up the this one and this is by far the best! Can't wait to read Deathly Hallows,44

0,"Watchable, but nothing more","Poseidon was a watchable movie, but was nothing worth watching again. From the original Posidion Adventure, and the TV remake of the Posidion Adventure where a cruise ship was flipped by terrorists, I think most people knew what to expect from this movie. Beyond the fast pace plot, which was way too fast in spots, the movie lacked character development, dialogue, and they could have at least filmed an actual cruise ship instead of that video game like opening sequence with the CGI ship.",84

1,Glorious!,"Except Sutherland's which is only on CD and (alas) has Pavarotti, this is the most beautiful Maria Stuarda I ever heard. The end is grim beyond belief, but that's not music. Devia is wonderful and while I can't honestly say I think she's the equal of Sills or Sutherland at the high notes, she is terrific nonetheless. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes Stuarda, Donizetti, Devia or music. I love it. Two notes. Elizabeth was crying at the final bows, and she and Devia embraced, clearly not enemies, though that needn't have been pointed out, though I liked it. And (damnit) another Stuarda without ""vil bastarda"" - is music having a renaissance of prudery?!Just had pointed out to me she does say ""vil bastarda"" - after ""impure daughter of Bolena"" near the end of her speech, but it's mulched into the words and music and easily (by me anyway) lost, not isolated and spat out like I'm sure I remember hearing from long ago. Still a beautiful performance anyway.",171

1,collection of 20 pure Hammett stories,"Dashiell Hammett put together a collection of 20 of his short stories in Nightmare Town. These 20 stories give a perfect reflection of the classic detective noir genre that Hammett gives life to.What happens when the only choices to be made do not follow a moral path but are the choices made ""between a rock and a hard place""? Hammett is what happens! His men are rough, tough and unyielding. His women are cold and calculating with no qualms about tears being shed to accomplish their desires. The dialogue is succinct. The brevity and clarity of each phrase are the hallmark of Hammett's work.The last tale, The Original Thin Man is the precursor to his novel The Thin Man which was made into a film that while following his basic work added a touch of levity with the stars William Powell and Myrna Loy.Hammett is the quintessential author of the classic detective story.",153

0,not what I was looking for-,I have always like EA games in the pass but this is one I should of skipped over. My main issue is this game is too much trouble to play with a mouse and just setting it up was a waste of time. I read trhe reviews before I purchased it and this is not the 1st time I bought something that had postives reviews but turn out to be a waste of both my time and money. If I though I could return it and use my money onsomething more to my liking them I would- an example of a great game is Dragon Age.,106

Now, it wasn't a ""feminine"" look at all, I looked more like a tomboy with it on. It wasn't a vuluptuous look, it made me look hefty. So, I would not recommend it at all, unless you favor the large upper torso ""butch"" look...",100

1,"Disco or Dance? Whatever you call it, it makes you move!","During the early 90's no group filled up the dance floor like C & C Music Factory. Once Zelma Davis's cry of ""Everybody Dance Now"" was heard, hordes of dancers jumped, gyrated, bumped and ground to their hearts content.This set of 10 extended remixes dramatically showcases the group headed by Robert Civilles and David Cole. From the familiar (""Gonna Make You Sweat,"" ""Here We Go Let's Rock & Roll,"" ""Things that Make You Go Hmmmmm...,"" and ""A Deeper Love"") to the more obscure (""Keep it Comin'"" and ""Robi-Robs' Boriqua Anthem""), ""Ultimate"" is the perfect party package.The Barry White-influenced ""Take a Toke"" is a welcome surprise among the selections.

0,Compare to Cooks Illustrated,"Bittman is great but this book is not, at least in the Kindle form. Before buying this I would recommend downloading the free Cook's Illustrated Cookbook and notice the difference between the Table of Contents and the Index. The Index is hyperlinked both for general subject AND for each individual recipe. Bittman's has no hyperlinked Index, only a Table of Contents, and this makes navigating around the cookbook very tedious. Buyer beware the lack of detailed hyperlinking in a reference book.

0,Hoover could do better,"Especially in this price range and with a reputation to uphold I expected more from this vacuum cleaner. The belt is VERY sensitive to breakage and not easily replaceable. You have to unscrew the bottom (4 screws) to replace the belt, where other vacuums I've owned have a bottom plate that pops off for easy maintenance. Also, when you use the on board tools for dusting, etc, the brush does not stop spinning so I have several burn marks in my carpet from where the vacuum rested in one spot too long (before I got wise and now lean the cleaner onto me as I use the on board tools). I would not buy another one, ever. The filter assembly is cumbersome to clean and even just emptying it out I usually end up with quite a bit of dust all over me. Look for something a bit better engineered. Hoover could certainly do better.",155
0,I was disappointed,"I felt that this book was poorly written in parts. For, example, I almost laughed out loud at one point where they were speculating about AntiCrist - underestimating him so much because he had poor grammar - gee, he can't write, obviously he must be an uneducated imbecile. The thought never crossed their mind that he could be pretending? Anyway, perhaps McDowell should stick to nonfiction.",66

0,Goodbye Mr. Jordan,"I like Julian Lennon, having bought and enjoyed Valotte, Help Yourself, and Photograph Smile. His gentle voice, harmonies, and piano certainly recall his father, but with his own perspective.Unfortunately, that perspective is missing here. In its place is Patrick Leonard, who served as producer and masterminded the transformation of Julian Lennon into a generic LA-glam guitar rocker. It doesn't work. Julian's voice is morphed through production to sound like a watered-down Bowie, singing over wailing processed LA guitar pyrotechnics and cheesy synth lines and beats.If I have described something you will like, by all means get this album. Otherwise I would move on.",103
0,You might want to pass this one up.,"Sorry, but I am agreeing with several of the other reviews who don't seem to care for this book too much. I got lost in the detail.

I have always enjoyed Woodwiss books but this is definitely not my favorite.",70
1,Real music,"All I got to say is, I'm from the Chi reppin to the fullest. I'm proud of Kanye. I got both of his CD's, and I'm very pleased. Finally we have artists making music that people really want to hear. Some real sh@t! Artists that's actually speaking about things that the average person experiences. Music with real live instruments and not just the computerized typed beats. I love Common and John Legend. The collaboration of all three is a breath of fresh air. Anyone who thinks less is hating big time. Like the two negative reviews on here. You can't even give a good legitmate reason why you think the album is bad. Because your hearing is being tuned out by the constant hating. Kanye, is a very talented artist, and it has been noted. That's why he has 6 grammys. So the majority wins. Haters find another hobby before you give yourself a headache.",155
1,Truth to Life,"A generally excellent book which gives a powerful argument for the importance of truth. There are a few points of discussion where I would have liked more details. He touches on the idea that truth is different in different domains I was left wanting to more about this. While he critiques pragmatism, it may be true that in certain domains the value of a concept is it's usefulness. Also of course there are areas of life where truth is clearly relative. If I say I like Mexican food, and you say Mexican foods is awful, who is right? Both are really stating the truth about their personal preferences. I would have liked more discussion of when truth is indeed relative, and stating that is my opinion is not just a way to avoid argument as Lynch suggests.",137

We got a set of 2650 mAh rechargeable batteries and they last for days in this camera. The pictures are rich in color and the movies with sound are excellent. The the large LCD screen, image stabilization, night and kids and pets modes make the camera very easy to use.

1,Avia - I See That Now...,"It may be a little premature to call this album a classic -- but it is excellent nonetheless. Avia's first EP, All My Jazz, was astounding, and his debut album confirms that promise. Corin Dingley and Andy Jenks from Alpha add their considerable talents to the proceedings. ""Miles Golden Sands"" is a house number, fluid and smooth. ""Warm"" is just that -- a lush, deep, throbbing number. Avia does slow just as well - ""Why Should I Cry"" wouldn't be out of place on any high-quality downtempo compilation. ""Westernize"" sounds like a leisurely film noir chase scene.

0,Sick of the Reruns,When in history did they ever make movies with one man going about the country and gunning down bad women? These movies are sexist and I just hope the people who enjoy this trash do not believe in it. I cannot even mention to anyone that I hate these sexist films to anyone because for some reason this makes me a male chauvinist pig. I will never understand why because I do know that there are some movies that were released on the theaters but were never released on VHS or DVD.These films are fantasy and a real insult to men. Someday this may all have an effect or it may not. I do not care. When they start making movies with bad women being gun down by a hero and then they are release on DVD or Blu-ray then maybe things are changing back to reality.,147

1,Too good for kids... ;) Awesome quality.,"Detailing of the squirrel, the range of motion on forearms, even the movement of the lower jaw, are so biomechanically believable I was astonished. It is very easily manipulated by medium sized hand, but may be too large for youngsters to work the arms and head/mouth at same time. The materials and structure are high quality and should be a lifetime purchase. However, I actually ordered this puppet to play interactively with my DOG!!! He loves his toys to be ""live"" and bite back... This puppet is super high quality and he will be able to carry the squirrel around by any of his appendages for years to come.This puppet will perfectly accompany the Gray Squirrel at Pacific Avenue storybook by Geri Harrington, part of the Smithsonian Institution's Backyard collection. For that reason I will purchase another one for my granddaughter! You will not be disappointed in either the quality of materials, construction, or detailing of this product.",158
0,Disappointing Style over Lack of Substance,"The narrative is told in an extremely disjointed fashion for no discernible purpose, other than to indulge in rather tedious foreshadowing, or perhaps to disguise the fact that, told in a straightforward narrative style, the plot is tedious int he extreme. Additionally, for purists of the series, the character of Leela bears almost no resemblance to the series character and is portrayed more as if she is Superman's sister than a real human being. There is a sequence when she is in the ocean--fighting off sharks and giant squids, and hitching rides on whales and surviving tornadoes, etc., etc. that is simply too ludicrous for words. As with most of the Doctor Who novels put out by BBC Books (and, for that matter, the earlier novels from Virgin), it would also benefit from tighter editing and a reduced page count.",140

1,I love the Pegster,I just recently met and lived with Peggy Kemner for a week. She is an awesome woman. Her writing is as simple and straight forward as she is.

Her life has been amazing and I have loved reading about only some of what she has experienced.,67
1,"Maybe not the most durable toy, but it's fun!","Like some previous reviews, my biggest complaint about this toy is that the monkey broke almost immediately. But that did not take away from the basic fun this toy provides. The rest of toy still works fine, and my kids never seemed to mind that the monkey wasn't dancing along with them. We've had this for over 6 months now, and it still gets played with almost daily. We have only replaced the batteries once in 6 months, so as long as you're using a brand name battery, I don't really think that's an issue with this toy. For the price I paid at the time, it was well worth the money spent!",113
1,solid sophmore lp,"with all of 50s extra controversy, its hard to just listen to this disc for its musical content. But putting all of the other stuff out of the way this is a pretty good effort from 50. The content of the album goes deeper than get rich or die trying, its not just boosting about having it all but giving some insight on certain topics. Baltimore Love Thing and God Gave Me Style or evidence of that. I wish people wouldnt give to much credit to all the beef since 50 really doesnt sell of the beef records (in da club, Pimp, Disco inferno and candy shop are all club bangers not beef records) So the content goes further than all the contreversy and as a whole it is a decent album.best songsthis is 50Im supposed to die tonightoutta controlski mask waygunz come outgod gave me style",147
0,Poorly designed,"This is an adequate shirt for the money IF you are of average height. The shirt is too short in the front if you are over 6' or so tall. They apparently took the measurements for a tail-less shirt and reduced the front length thus leaving a tail.The shirt is prone to a small amount of shrinkage (like most cotton) even in cold water. Therefore sizing is particularly critical here.The Blake and Hollister (probably the same company) are generally better (except for the vertical rib shirt, which is way to small in length for the indicated size).Note that the positive reviews here may have been planted...none of the reviewers reviews anything but shirts from this company.",116
1,"works as well as OEM, much lower price","This antenna works perfectly with my Garmin GPSMap 195, though there is no difference in performance compared to the original Garmin antenna. This one is active, drawing a little power from the batteries, while the original is passive.Since the performance is the same, the main benefit to this antenna is cost: about $20 instead of $100 for the original Garmin antenna. So while it didn't meet its claims of superior performance in my old GPS, it performs on par with the original while costing significantly less which makes it a good value.P.S. the latest version of this antenna does NOT have removable magnets. I called Gilsson, they told me they changed the design of this antenna and no longer offer removable magnets, and they swapped mine for one of their last ones that did have removable magnets. Thus this antenna can no longer be used by pilots mounting it above the panel near the compass.",155

Crotch rockets with arms. . .So the main character (ballerina) quits ballet due to an injury and becomes involved in motorcycles. . .a comparison of riding and touching the sky to freedom fits together in an obscure way. The backstory is not really far-fetched, but political/military conspiracy to destabilize the government for its world domination agenda. There are some CGI clips that are pretty awesome. The closing is descent, however, it seemed too short of a series. The gaps in time are left to the viewers imagination for character buildup and adds to the storyline progression. On a personal note, Yamaha R1 engines should have been installed for top performance.",124

Wear a sweat band or you will drip sweat from your head for sure like I did...or workout in front of a fan.I love that she said 'do not erase what you did here today with eating poorly'. SO TRUE!!!

1,Great debut album!,"I had seen Pete play several times around town and was impressed by his technique, but when I bought the CD one night at one of his gigs and started listening to it on the way home I realized what a gifted instrumental composer he is, too. Pete's styles on this CD run the gamut from blues to new age to folk. While you can hear the influence of tappers like Michael Hedges and Preston Reed in his playing, Pete doesn't overdo it as is the case with so many in this genre. He uses it only to the extent that the tunes require it, always making sure to put the focus on the music. Great technique, great compositions, great interpretations, all from a guy who makes his living defending the innocent (and not so innocent). I can't wait for his follow up CD later this year.-Rod SaundersDirector, Tulsa Guitar Society",151
1,Great Phone,"I received the phone as promised. I really like using it for a small business that I operate out of my home. I too find that the buttons are hard to read without glasses (maybe getting too old??). Also, the fact that the phone hangs up if you place it back in the charge base is a pain. And for someone with larger hands like mine it's cumbersome to remove it from the charge base.Other than that, I really like the sound quality and reception. Additionally, the headset is extremely comfortable and that's really good since I use the phone for hours at a time.Bottomline - buy it....it's a great value for the money!",114

1,"We're all looking glasses, we girls","I was really surprised by this book. The cover image does not (or at least not to me) hint at what this story is really about, which made the depth of the characterizations and the compelling story line a pleasant surprise. At the beginning, I was a little bored with the idea that the story would take place at an English girls boarding school--midnight feasts and mean girls, no thanks--but as the novel continued and the author showed us more and more about Gemma and her fellow students, the story became riveting. I especially liked how Ms. Bray portrayed the stifling aspects of life for young women in Victorian England and made us feel their frustrations and need to rebel. I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to picking up the story of Gemma and The Order inRebel Angels.",141

1,This Book is a Must Read!,"This book affected me profoundly. Quite unexpectedly, I found myself in tears often while reading it, not out of any particular joy or sorrow, but because it touched my heart so deeply. Universal truths are revealed in its pages, and the author demonstrates how we can walk our talk and be our authentic selves by following our inner guidance. It conveys how living transpersonally does not mean sacrificing anything about the personal. We learn that our personal experiences are actually enhanced and enriched when our focus is on more than the self. This is a must read, as it will take you on a journey of compassion, hope, truth and love.",111

'Believe', 'When I Look at You', 'Only Love', 'She Was Here', 'Lulluby', and 'You Are My Home' made me cry. 'The Scarlett Pimpernel', 'The Creation of Man', and 'They Seek Him Here' made me laugh. 'Vivez!' and 'Storybook' made me dance, and 'Where's the Girl?' seduced me with it's magic. There is only one thing to be said for this music; Beautiful!",119

1,"""Effing Awesome"" and Raw","Wow - The story is fantastic, the acting is good overall, and phenomenal by Nicolas Cage. Amber Heard plays a fabulous tough girl with a heart - and she's a really good badass chick, IMO. There's a couple of scenes that definitely entitle this to its R rating, along with the language. The action just keeps on going, with a few short moments of back story. There's enough twists to keep strong interest, and enough predictability to make you right in your anticipation, enough craziness to last all night long. While I don't know how to write reviews, I really love the movie and strongly recommend it to people who like action and some darkness, nonsense and wonder.",118

1,price was right,"out of the box mine had a few scuffs and gouges from shipping, despite good packaging. nothing i thought it needed to be returned for. the legs of the table attach securely without any modifications. the dowels on the chair needed some gluing for a more solid fit, all of the screws aligned well and did not require anything extra.as for construction, it's made in Thailand, the wood is stained and lightly finished pine, or other soft wood. everything is cut from boards, ie. the angled chair back. it's sturdy, the finish will not withstand heavy use/abuse (on the bright side it will get that 'distressed' look quickly!). I have boys, i didn't want an expensive table knowing it would have to endure them :-), so this table is perfect. in closing, i'm happy with it; it looks nice and if it gets abused it can be easily repaired, sanded, painted or rebuilt.",153

This one fits the bill. I've had it for 6 weeks, use it every night. I ordered extra filters when I ordered the product. I fill the reservoir with cooled, boiled water just to avoid adding or attracting any mold spores, but that's not a requirement. I find that it runs very quietly and I am a light sleeper.

So I saw this version and thought, great! Less counter space and it's portable.Every time I use it, the nozzle pops out while I'm cleaning, which sprays water all over and requires me to stop, refit the nozzle and then continue--for another few seconds until it pops out again. By then, the chamber is empty and has to be refilled with water. The regular WaterPik holds enough water to last for two minutes. That's about the amount of time needed to do a thorough cleaning. This device runs out in about twenty to thirty seconds. And the dial at the base of the nozzle, which you're supposed to turn to direct the stream where you want it, tends to ensure that the nozzle pops out.This is almost useless.

0,Unmet Expectations,"The Game has the potential to be an exquisite thriller if it had remained the homage to revenge fantasies it started out being. However, towards the climax of the film, the rug is rudely ripped out from under the feet of the viewer as we are now treated to a film that decided to be a thinking man's thriller. In order for the Game to be a thriller, there would have to be genuine thrills instead of jaw-droppingly pallid scenes involving Douglas plunging to near-certain death only to ""miraculously"" survive. Apparently, the filmmaker has mistaken roller-coaster ride style shocks for thrills of a psychological bent.The pseudo twist ending made the film an incoherent mess and failed to invite the viewer to reflect at all. And I watched this film closely.In summary, the Game is an entertaining watch if its on TV for free and you've nothing better to watch.",149

I cannot listen to this album without constantly hearing John Cage, Yoko Ono, Brian Eno and Ofra Haza and even the Art of Noise. I enjoy many of these artist because their art is authentic. Chandra's philosophy of song is woefully sophmoric and derivative. Yes it reminds me of those late night bull sessions -- in junior high school.",132
1,Bloodrayne and the Third Reich,"Natassia Malthe takes over as Bloodrayne and this time she is hunting vampires in German occupied Russia. The plot is about turning Hitler into a vampire who inturn can turn a whole army into the undead to fight his war for world conquest. The highlight of the film is seeing Ron Howards brother, Clint, as the mad German scientist.",59
1,Great! But wanted more story about Ramsey.,"I really loved this book, but I had been waiting since ""The Secret"" for a story that I hoped would focus on Ramsey Sinclair, as he was written to be the more ""irresistible"". I enjoyed Brodick but didn't find his character in ""The Secret"" to be that exciting. At any rate, ""Ransom"" is well written and I did enjoy reading it.",61
0,Disappointed,"I read the two previous Aunt Dimitys and enjoyed them thoroughly, but this will be my last. Although the writing is good, Lori and Bill are delightful characters, and the setting is lovely, the Aunt Dimity trick is just too silly after awhile.

1,review of The Apartment,"I buy films for the local Alliance Francaise, and this is one of them. The U.S. film Wicker Park was based on this film.

The very beautiful Monica Bellucci is also nude, but we don't get to see anything.",60

0,"Not as good or funny as ""My 'Dam Life""","Although highly recommended I thought the novel's tone was nasty. It is quite simply another example of the British (authors are Brits) making themselves sound superior to everyone else. While the material may be accurate, the attitude does not lend itself to humor--unless you enjoy humor at the expense of another culture.A much better and infinitely funnier book is, ""My 'Dam Life"" by Sean Condon. This memoir by an Australian expat living in Amsterdam covers much of the same material and enlightens about Dutch culture but is well edited. It is rife with imagery that will not soon be forgotten; imagery woven into hilarious narratives on topics such as Queen's Day, housing difficulties, bicycles, and not surprisingly Holland's flat landscape. How flat is it? It is so flat...""that when you look toward Belgium you can see a man on a step ladder waving..."" Now that's funny.",146

0,Literal playing is NOT art!,"If you follow the scores as you listen, you'll discover that the Klenke Quartet plays all the notes as written, but to quote Toscanini, they do not know what to do ""between the p here and the f there.""

0,Only for Extreme Felix Historians Only,"This DVD has attractive packaging, well designed menus and good background on the animations....BUT viewing the shorts is difficult. They are mostly grainy, dark in contrast, and some are so damaged they are painful to watch. There has been no attempt to restore these films on any level and the prints are as rough as I have seen in ANY silent era film on DVD currently available. The music score makes no attempt to compliment the action, but it's just honkytonk piano playing random songs in the background. I give this DVD 1 star for content and historic value, but for viewing enjoyment, its a dud.",106
1,first and favorite Gooseberry Patch for me,"Let me be honest: I never in a million years would have picked up a Gooseberry Patch cookbook around 2003, when my mom bought this for me at Christmas. I would have thought it was too country and hokey. But after trying a few of the recipes, I was hooked! There are a few duds in the bunch but most of them have been wonderful and I've added many to my cooking repertoire for the past 7-8 years now. My favorite is the Chewy Gingersnaps; they have become my holiday signature and the only problem is everyone requests them throughout the year. I've since tried out several other Gooseberry Patch cookbooks and enjoyed most of them, but this one remains my favorite.",122

At first it worked fine, but now after only 6 months, it no longer functions. We generally make about 6 cups at a time. For the past month or so, it would only run through about half the water. If we restarted it, then it ran rest of the water. Now it doesn't work at all and we have to go through the hassle of seeing if it repairable. Very annoying. Other coffee makers have lasted us about 10 years or so on average. This is really disappointing!",105

0,Evil Made Mundane,"Farah's book is a mundane recount of her marriage as third wife of the shah of Iran. She tells of their meeting, a short married life before the despot - except she doesn't mention he was a despot - was overthrown, her playing around with public works, fleeing the country, and the pariah the shah became as no country would take in the ousted dictator. She also tells of the death of her daughter. This is sort of like Eva Braun telling of her life(...), but leaving out the messy parts. Farah leaves out the parts about how the shah ruthlessly persecuted all opposition, and how Iran had the most corrupt judicial system in the world. Reviewers below sound moronic and slavish, just the sort of subjects the shah welcomed. All others were dying to get rid of him. He ran a corrupt goverment and set the stage for the even worse government in Iran today. Some legacy.",158
1,Outstanding quality!,"Over the years I've owned three Blackhawk Rigger's belts, two were issued and I bought this one. The two that were issued are still in my closet and get used but they are black and new uniform requirements required tan.These belts are great! I've used them for years at sea and never had a problem with rust on the metal parts. The Velcro has never gotten weak and, though I have gear for carrying weapons, these belts also serve well for carrying a sidearm.The construction of these belts makes them very comfortable in thick uniform trousers. Wearing them with jeans is a little less comfortable but wearing them with lightweight khakis or shorts is not something I would recommend, the edge of the belt tends to ride above the waist of lighter trousers. If you're wearing a riggers belt because you need it, you probably shouldn't be wearing lightweight khakis or shorts though.",153
0,Give Credit Where Credit Is Due,"The book has some great information that, when applied, can make some significant changes in a person's life. After reading numerous other works from authors in the self-help and academic arena, I discovered that a lot of what Mr. Robbins shares is the work of other people who paid the price to learn the techniques and methods. The information is based on sound research, yet very little is credited to the researchers. Just one of numerous examples is the concept of NAC. Mr. Robbins was in a legal dispute for using NLP, so he simply changed the name, added a few twists, and voila -- a new change technology. The information gets an ""A"", but Mr. Robbins gets a ""D-"" for ethics.",122

XIII is not Matrix, it cant do the same. Also, the Bot challenge was bad, you play against (or with)computers. The AI is bad and weapons are hard to handle.The story was confusing, still no idea what's going on.

As well, the juicer attachment, over time, since it doesn't have a very tight fit over the motor shaft, will simply stop turning when pressure is applied.I returned the unit and opted for the more expensive Breville Citrus Juicer.That unit is magnitudes better than the Waring unit.My recommendation is to not even consider buying the Waring unit.

Keira Knightley does a great job of balancing Carell as his equal, not support.

0,This Ain't No Goodfellas,"This film failed on so many levels that it's hard to summarize its shortcomings. Suffice to say that lack of cohesiveness OR character development resulted in a totally unsatisfying film experience. I'm stunned that Scorsese was willing to lend his name to this production (though interestingly you WON'T find his name anywhere on the DVD case/notes). The reviews I read suggested this was a greater showcase of the ""reality"" of the so-called mafia, and that may be true...the real mafia likely consists of uneducated thugs with little to look forward to, and absolutely no sense of the value of human life. Unfortunately, such characteristics do NOT a good movie make. I'd pass on this one, and wait until Scorsese decides to make another ""unreal"" crime flick.",126

The plot is fantastic...a Middle Eastern group of terrorists discover a nuclear bomb in Syrian farmland and try to get it working again. They set it off during the Super Bowl & along with another terrorist group in Germany, try to trigger WWIII. This is a scary part of the book as the US and then USSR go to the brink of nuclear war.

You would think that these characters have been used up and any story involving them must be boring and revamped. I am here to tell you, THIS BOOK IS INCREDIBLE and is everything that is right about Star Trek. Especially recommended for those very familiar with TOS episodes and movies, as it bookends the story using scenes from various episodes, etc with flawless execution. Bones McCoy has never been so well written and his character so fully exposed as in this work. If you are a fan of classic Star Trek, the episode 'City on the Edge of Forever,' and a Dr. McCoy fan, you simply MUST read this. Highest Recommendation!",128

1,The ACD Method,"I think the other responses to this book are valid, but I have some things to add. I was lucky enough to participate in Mark Fisher's summer internship program, so I was taught be him and his traders at MBF. We used the ACD method during live trading, but it wasn't the only method that we used. In addition to the ACD method, we used technical and fundamental analysis to plan our trades. If the ACD indicators aligned with other indicators we used, then we could place our trades. Not every trade panned out when that happened, but it did make a profit more often than not. The Logical Trader gives you a good starting point if you're a beginner, but nothing can serve as a substitute for actual trading experience.Yes, of course the benchmarks listed in the book are outdated, but you can make your own benchmarks after you've traded for awhile.",153

Then they talk about a few of his bigger movies like A star is born and Heaven's gate but no mention of his other great movies like Convoy, Welcome home and Songwriter. There's barely any mention of what he was up to during the late 70's and 80's.I just think that more effort could of been put into this project and treat the fans to something decent.

Believe it or not, where the first three reincarnations had teens not yet graduated from college (remember ""Angel Grove""?), this one and the seriously reincarnated Lightspeed Rescue puts these former superstars in a whole new role. Here, they work for their masters, and most recently, they even have jobs, but who cares? Can you imagine the ridiculous craze that stormed the world years ago? Make it stop once and for all!",119

1,A wonderful debut!,"I don't believe I have every read a first novel that has been nearly as impressive as Shwarz's Drowning Ruth. It is a story about love, family, children and making something out of unbearable circumstances. The characters are numerous and well-developed. The story is captivating and suspenseful - the reader only finding out in bits and pieces what has actually happened as Schwarz swiftly switches between the past and the present. I would liken her writing to Anita Shreve if anyone; fun and interesting yet inundated by deep issues of morality, shame and love. Finished easily in a few days, I anxiously await her next work.",106

0,The New Terrorism: More of the Same Old Stuff,"For those readers wanting a survey of modern terrorism and its possible courses of development, this book will suffice. The New Terrorism presents a well-researched case that the intent of modern terrorists may increasingly be to simply cause death and damage. The author's inclusion of the criminally insane within his definition of terrorism is simultaneously disputable and thought provoking. However, the book does a poor job in thoroughly exploring the concept of WMD terrorism. This, in conjunction with organizational problems and some of the author's style choices, should place this book somewhere other than the top of potential reader's buy lists. Jessica Stern provides a far better alternative in her ""Ultimate Terrorists.""",112
0,Falls apart - pieces not meant to stay together,"I bought this for my son for Christmas thanks to that bald, little baby talking pain, Cailliu who got a space station for Christmas in his Holiday Movie. So I ordered this with high expectations that it would be my son's favorite toy. Unfortunately, it won't stay together. So the pieces that are meant to click in place, do but do not stay. Other parts that are supposed to are IMPOSSIBLE to get in place and the plastic is that hard, unbending, plastic that if you force will crack and break. If it weren't for Cailliu- don't get me started, I'd be returning this immediately. Definitely not worth forty-five dollars, not even worth fifteen. DO NOT BUY unless you want a space station that comes apart with the slightest bump.",130
1,Listen to this Late at Night (or Any Other Time),"James Figurine is the Postal Service's Jimmy Tamborello solo album. I, being a fan of the alternative/indie music scene, remember back in 2003 when he teamed up with another favorite Ben Gibbard from Death Cab For Cutie recording ""Give Up"". It was a nice sounding electronic/indie record of sad and deep songs that ended up selling a lot of records.Now with this album Jimmy Tamborello uses the alias James Figurine (I'm not sure why or how he came up with it). The album feature materials that is slightly different from his stuff with The Postal Service. He uses a different vocal style by slowly whispering the lyrics and his thoughts making it interesting. He even has friend and fellow musician Jenny Lewis of Rilo Kiley on the song ""You Again"". This is a great album to put on late at night when you return from clubbin' to fall asleep with.",150
1,Women Finally Wakes Up and Realizes She's POed at Her Family,"This book was fun to read, I started in on a Friday evening and had finished it by Sunday. I am a middle aged women who has her own spoiled family, it was so easy to identify with the main character, who has finally had it, and is angry. Terry McMillan has a great skill for writing dialog and the flow of reading this translated well to imaginging what I was reading from the words on the page to picturing each scenario in my mine, actually hearing how the characters were speaking and the emphasis they would use in their sentences as Ms. McMillan wrote them. Its a pleasure to find a novel you can identify with and that is so relaxing and enjoyable to read.",126

0,cheap yellow lights from a shoddy company (Viatek),"I purchased three sets of these to use during an indoor/outdoor party. I think rechargeable LED candles are a great idea, but these LED lights are made very poorly. There was at least one candle in every set that didn't work at all (a total of 4 candles from 3 sets that didn't work) and then a couple that keep very short lived charges and flicker out (within two hours) much sooner than the rest. I called an emailed Viatek with no response. After, the third call, someone picked up the phone and said that they would send replacements. They never did, and a follow up call went unanswered as well. Also, the yellow light emitted by these candles is very yellow compared to a real candle flame, it isn't natural looking. If you plan to mix yellow LED candles (like these) with real candles, the difference will be glaringly obvious. Go for a -warm- white LED candle as opposed to the yellow LED candle (they do exist).",168
0,Frustrating.,"At its best, it's quite funny. But at its worst, this book is snarky and obnoxious (and, alas, about what you'd expect given the author's work history). Not to mention the profanity, which was a real disappointment, and made the author look juvenile. At the fourth or fifth expostulation of ""Jesus!"" I got fed up. And that was only 50 pages in. It's a very amusing idea, but I'm not convinced enough that it'll sustain a 350-page book that I want to read the next 300 pages of this. Next time get an editor who'll make this book accessible to people beyond the look-aren't-I-clever-and-naughty set.",105

0,Could not find a compatible carseat,"Pros:-Large, easily accessible basket.-Large cup/snack holder.-Long handle keeps you from kicking the stroller wheels as you walk.Cons:-Most car seats *do not* snap onto the frame including some that are supposedly compatible according to the manual (including my Graco SnugRide, which did not fit).-The only thing left to secure the carseat to the frame is a belt that snaps across the middle of the carseat. If you run into something, the car seat flips upward, pivoting on the strap.I took this to Babies R Us and tried it with all the infant seats, but could not find one that actually snapped onto the cross bar of this stroller frame (tried Evenflo, Combi, Graco SafeSeat). I was disappointed because I do like the design of the stroller and would have kept it if I could find a compatible carseat. I ended up returning this and getting a Graco SnugRider stroller frame instead - not as nice but at least my Graco seat sanps onto it securely.",164

0,This book is not about the tango,"I can only confirm that this book is not about the tango but mostly about the personality of Marina Palmer. Given that the target group is that of TANGO lovers, not Marina Palmer fans, this book feels like a bait-and-switch.What it shows clearly, however, is that whatever you do and wherever you go, you will always take yourself along. Being professionally frustrated and having a low self-esteem makes one see the outer world in negative colors and attract wrong kind of people.I am sure that if Marina Palmer were to enter the world of, say, basket-weaving or table tennis she would find them just as wicked and disillusioning as her world of Argentine tango turned out to be.",118

I can not stop listening to this CD, I put it on then I can't stop it! They have the best sing-along songs and just get you in the mood to dance your ass off! I saw them live at me high school and they got kicked off because they used the ""f-word"" too much, still, the guys in the band were some of the coolest around, they went around and talked with all of us.

1,It's OK... Update it works well!,"Only works in manual. I use it with the sx20, but a much better flash is the sunpak pz40 that is also affordable and works with canon. So, basically it doesn't know that the camera is there, and you have to adjust all the flash compensation manually. Actually, the only thing it DOES do automatically is fire when the camera takes a shot. Alright, now for the pros. First off, you can obtain any shutter speed you want with the right flash exposer. Let's say that if ASA(ISO) is 800, and the aperture is 4 and the flash is on full, you can get a pic with the flash illuminating to about 50-60 ft with any shutter speed you like. I'd rate it a 3 1/2 if i could.The following link is to the better flash. Note that it only sells for $70 at B&H.;Sunpak PZ40X Power Zoom Digital Flash for all Canon EOS TTL, E-TTL and E-TTL II Cameras (Black)",161
1,"Get this game, its alot of fun",The old West theme really works. They do a great job with the robots and the old west bandits. The weird 1970s version of outer space art is really imaginative and colorful. AWESOME GAME. The aliens look like desparados and the AI is above average. Its long and lots of fun for just a few dollars. This game got a raw deal in the ratings.,65
0,Stop!,"I was very unhappy with the picture quality of this item. To get a picture clear enough to see detail, I had to turn the color off and the brightness to max. This washed out the picture. There is no contrast control.....There is no contrast in the picture. There is very little green in the picture, Everything looks blue/red/and purple. I bought a WinTV adapter for my laptop computer. It has video inputs. The picture quality through my WinTV adapter is 100% better. If this is an option for you, for a laptop or PC, try this first...It quickly connects to the USB port on the computer. Oh yes...you can re-size the picture to whatever you like. The picture suffers if you expand it to fit the monitor, but at about 8-10 inches it is good.",136

1,Not the fanciest but...,I had this product over 3 years ago. The batter eventually didn't hold a charge so I bought a fancy one from Fry's Electronics. It sucked. The fanciest with all the attachments and stuff...you don't need it. Keep it simple and this is the best one.,46

1,Indispensible for the serious birder,"This book is one of my favorite birding books. I am reticent to call it a field guide because it is so much more than that. Incredible amounts of information on all the sparrows. Great range maps AND descriptions of migration and vagrancy (can I hope to see this bird in my area?), and all the other natural history and behavior information you'd expect. Beautiful plates showing ALL the different plumages, primary and basic, male, female and juvenal. And it's not just a wealth of information, it's a beautiful book, well written and a delight to own.",97

1,One of the best,"Donald R. Burgett has produced four excellent works concerning his experiences while a member of Col. Bob Sink's 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the fabled 101st Airborne Division. His details of his experiences of training and jumping into battle at Normandy put you right in the thick of his experiences. His graphic descriptions of what he saw, smelled, tasted and felt will bring you right into this environment like no other book I've read. The action comes fast and this is a book that you can't put down and will read from chapter to chapter and then be disappointed when you finish the book if you don't have his next work about Operation Market garden,The Road to Arnhem.I recommend all of Burgett's books about his experiences and the humble man who wrote them. This is a must read for WWII history fans and 101st Airborne fans.",146

1,I wore this for 4 weeks and had no problems.,"This money belt is great! I went to Ireland and Scotland for 4 weeks and literally wore this all day, everyday except in the shower. I even slept with this on and I didn't feel it. I stayed in hostels and was 18 at the time so I wanted my important belongings safe and wearing this gave me that sense of security. It's soft and flexible and you don't feel it when you wear it. It held my 2 ID cards, my bank card, my passport, plane ticket and all money I had on me that I wasn't going to use that day and you couldn't tell I was wearing it. This money belt is super comfortable and will fit just about anyone. The belt is stretchy and easily adjustable. I love how it's made out of silk and not stiff uncomfortable nylon like other brands. I actually gave this to my best friend who went to the UK a couple years later and she loved it. Highly recommended!",169

0,"If you are looking for trading ideas, look elsewhere","This book contains an almost painful amount of detail concerning the organizational structure as well as the investor base of the hedge funds whose managers it profiles. Unfortunately, as far as actual trading strategies are concerned, it is a complete failure. It will tell you in which areas a fund is active, but give you excactly zero detail about the strategies and tactics used by its managers. Even some rather bad books I have read at least contained one or two ideas that were worth investigating, but I couldn't gain anything at all from this book. Also, some of the track records really aren't that impressive. Not really bad, but definitely not what you'd expect from ""Superstars"".",117

The ellipses, the heavy-handed jargon, the cavalier assumption that you know what she means, or that if you don't she doesn't much care, are as much the overcodings of an academic coterie as a smack in the face for conventional scholarship.""--Terry Eagleton, in THE LONDON REVIEW OF BOOKS",93
1,This Book is a Great Resource.,"I bought this book 7 years ago, and have referred to it time and time again. I teach Intuition classes [...]. Part of what I teach includes understanding natural life cycles. I use Demetra George's book to show my students all the aspects of a moon cycle and to remind them that all parts of the cycle, including the time of the Void (Dark Moon) are important in life. This book also provides excellent information about the Goddess Hecate, the old wise women who helps us in the night. George's book is very empowering for women and attaches the female spirit to ancient women's knowledge before it was changed and distorted by conflicting religions and societal influences. I recommend this book.",121

1,just another review,"Garou is an extremely talented singer! It was his role in Notre Dame, which is brilliant by the way, that led me to listen to Seul. His voice is low and gravelly but it's beautiful and pure masculinity in my opinion. Perhaps some of the songs on the album are a bit too ""pop-ish"" but give the man a break - it's his first album and I think he did a great job with it. Anyway, the songs aren't as important as the way he sings them - with a lot of passion and heart! I'm enjoying it :)",99

1,Fine coverage for a modest price.,"Over 2,000 patches and tabs are represented in this remarkably comprehensive guide. From World War I to the present, not only the Army (with a fine selection of pocket and unofficial patches), but also Army Air forces and Aviation, Navy, Marine Corps, Civil Air Patrol, and National Guard are logically organized, illustrated in full color, and identified with checkoff boxes for the collector.The excellent production values, generous coverage, illustrated essay on patch construction, guide to correct wear, handy table of contents, glossary, World War II organizational chart, and other useful features make this possibly the best patch guide available today, and certainly the most for the modest price. Highly recommended for the collector, WWII buff, and student of military history. (Also available in softcover.)(The ""score"" rating is an ineradicable feature of the page. This reviewer does not ""score"" books.)",139

The Doggy Steps from tv are sturdy, well made and hold up well. These were cheap, flimsy and the cover kept bunching up. Disappointed that they tried to trick me here. Don't fall for it!

I tried to use it to pick up the loose debris on the floor before attempting the wash function. It picked up less than my Swifter and seemed to blow things all over and I got VERY frustrated. My husband tried it and determined it was defective or something was loose. He called Hoover and they said to bring it to a service center. The alternative was disassembling and packing it to return to Amazon, a daunting prospect right before Christmas. I just got it back last week and still have not tried it. At this point it is too late to return to Amazon and I hope it works. There is nothing worse than a vacuum that blows dirt all over the floor. I will hold my breath and try it next week, almost two months after purchasing it. I am not a happy camper and probably will not buy another Hoover product.",172

BIG disappointment......While Gergiev's operatic approach is viable, this performance is like a string of stop and go ideas. Yes Fleming and Borodina maintain their reputations, as does bass D'Arcangelo, but when will record producers stop pulling Bocelli out of his Pop element and let him blast away at ballads instead of blistering opera? This ends up being a commercial vehicle for Bocelli fans instead of a contribution to the bulging ranks of recorded Verdi Requiems. Makes you wonder why Gergiev consented to record this.

Frog and Toad each has their own distinct personalities and together they compliment each other. My favourite story from this book is ""Tomorrow"" in which Toad, lazing in bed, as always, puts off every single chore until tomorrow and then he starts to worry about what a hectic day he is going to have tomorrow so he gets up and does each chore now so he won't have to do it tomorrow.

0,Extreamly disapointing and a BIG waste of money!,I felt these projects were poorly executed and generally bad looking. I would hate to spend the time wrapping a gift like some of these and actually give to someone. The book could have been soooo much better.

All information in this book has been stated in a better, more precise way in its predecessor.The only news in this book is that is not unhealthy to take walks, be good to yourself, follow a healthy diet, get enough sleep, think postively. The most revolutionary piece of advice is, on the other hand, a real breakthrough: Buy yourself flowers once in a while. This will guarantee optimum health in 8 weeks, at least to anyone who buys the book. Come on, dr. Weil, how stupid do you think we are?",112
1,Super freaking cute but a little small.,They came right on the 23rd (1st possible delivery date). They are brand new in the original box. They are a perfect fit for my 16 month old. I've always been a Reebok Classic fan.Updated: My baby got to wear these maybe 4 times. They aren't made wide enough for toddlers. She had plenty of room length wise but the shoe was squeezing the top and sides of her feet. Go a size up if you buy these. I just bought her the white in 4.5. We'll see how they work out.,92

0,I should have known better,"The price was right($20), that should have been my first clue to the poor quality.The sound was ok at best. Low end was a bit muffled and the high's were not crisp.They blocked out un-wanted noise out adaquately, but the inter-changable buds are prone to falling off and getting lost way to easily. There is no case or protective pouch for storage. The gauge of the wire is too thin and the jacket of the wire is easily damaged. The in-line volume control switch feels cheap and flimsy, like it ready to break apart.I did not expect awesome sounding headphones for $20. For the price, I expected a decent sounding pair that was well constructed so it could take some abuse.I cannot recommend these headphones based on the poor construction and vunerability of the earbuds getting lost.Do not waste your money on these headphones. keep looking and be prepared to spend a little more. It will be worth it in the long run.",163

1,"Brilliantly written, scholarly treatise","Few people have ever impacted American culture as did Elvis Presley; his contribution to rock music is immeasurable. Guralnick takes a scholarly approach and writes a carefully researched, detailed biography of The King. The first book deals with his meteoric rise from humble beginnings; the second deals with superstar Elvis and his sad decline. No doubt readers will wonder how they could have saved Elvis if only they'd known him; unfortunately, the only person who could have saved Elvis was himself. Forces and fate no doubt played a role which drove Elvis to use drugs as an escape from the stresses and abnormality of his life.Both books by Guralnick stand alone as well-written biographies of the King. However, I recommend reading them both to get the full impact. It is refreshing to have available a serious, respectful book on Elvis Presley that's void of the usual sensationalistic, simplistic trash found in other, hastily-churned-out Presley biographies.",155
1,Really really good,downloaded this because it was free. I liked it so much I bought the other books in the series. Ivy Malone is a likeable character that keeps finding herself in a situation with a murder that needs to be solved. She doesn't just sit back and let others handle it she keeps getting involved. Very funny stories. I would highly recommend them. I wish she would write some more.,69

0,A devastating disapointment,"The cinematography is awful. This film probably cost $100 to make and was filmed on a home camcorder. The one good thing about the film is the Nate, the beautiful, ripped army hunk marine.Shame he falls in love with a little gay goth who wears eye liner. The only good thing in the film was ruined when the goth paints his new army hunk boyfriend's eyes with eyeliner. Someone who was involved in the film is clearly into wearing eyeliner, and has put his style and stamp into the movie and in doing so ruined the one good thing about it.I'm off to buy some eyeliner now - i've been converted!!! GAYS FOR EYELINER!!",114
1,Germany and the cold war,"What ever all the others wrote, I live in Germany and know this time of cold war - 30 km behind the borderline. Vehicles are not authentic, helicopter too - but the message is another, it could have caused the next war for sure.Both are very good soldiers, but forgotten, the new time is different. But thank you - to you all - who came to Germany and to be with us against the communists. Germany would have had its reunification much earlier without all Nato's soldiers. But today we have freedom and friendship to all our neighbors and to russia to!I give 5 Stars, 3 for the movie and two for the other votes wich were too bad (my opion).",121

1,The story goes on...,"And that is what you mainly get out of this game--great story. Very well written dialogues, imaginative plot that built upon the epic scope of The Longest Journey, and solid, believable characters aren't that easy to find in the world of video games, and especially sequels. But Dreamfall has all of that in spades in addition to being a very pretty game. But it is the ""game"" part that is spoiling the mix for me. Or I should say, the lack thereof is. Dreamfall plays too much like an interactive movie, and the further you get into the game, the longer all the cinematics/dialogue scenes get, however ingrossing they may be. The Longest Journey was not a terribly difficult game, but the puzzles in Dreamfall are just too easy, as well as scarce. This has greatly detracted from my enjoyment--too often did my hands drop from the controls, because I wasn't the one driving. 4 out of 5 stars.",159

Very good album from MORE than a regular artist. Add THIS one to your collection.",71
1,Understanding is a good thing,"Is propaganda having more adherents truth, and that having fewer mind-control? Power is self-serving. It only seeks to extend itself, consolidate itself, protect itself. To that end control of the population's world-view is crucial. In some countries it's less sophisticated; in others it's more so. People, however, are quite alike in fundamental ways. It's a shame we don't have more statesman encouraging dialogue and mutual understanding and promoting the COMMON GOOD (which, it seems to me, should be a matter of common sense). ""ALL MEN are created equal . . .""",91

Well, this ancient piece of junk wouldn't even install on my two years old laptop and, as I learnt it later, has nothing in common with current version of ""Red Hat"". I was really furious, why this outdated trash that is not compatible with today's hardware is still offered?

0,Crude!,I'm disappointed with their third album. The first two albums rocked and I saw a lot of potential for them to move into the heavier land of rock but instead they took the softer route and now they're too mellow for my music pleasure. I think couples would enjoy this music for love making but I want something hard core.......like TOOL!!! How can the guitarist play the bass too in concert? I think Creed needs to step back to the Human Clay sound for their next album or they'll end up like Metallica.......and that's not a good place to be.........good luck!,101

1,Great Game,"This game would get 5 *s if it wasn't so...hard! You see, there are 10 goals that need completed in each level, in any order, but they are by no means easy in any way. You can just do the easy ones at first, to get to the first couple boards. But then the goals just get difficult to the point where playing any longer becomes a horror. Plus, you have to start over from the very beginning every time you complete a goal. It is also tough to figure out what the goals actually ARE. They are stated in the form of 4-line ""poems"" that can be accessed at any time by pressing the BACK button.This game is not racy in-and-of itself, but is rated ""T"" because of the extreme plot line. You are a young bat (stay with me) whose parents were killed by a king, so now you vow deadly revenge on the ruler, and I'm guessing that your quest is to kill him and take over as king.It's a fun time, and a recommended title; if you are willing to devote a WHOLE lotta hours on it.",191

0,Atrocious,"Atrocious sequel to the big horror hit ""Carrie"" from the late 70's. The original written by Stephen King was a complete success and this frankly isn't. It is 24 years later and still the scars from that night where everybody met the real Carrie White exists. Now, out of the blue, some producer decides to write a sequel! Why? The plot is very thin. Emily Bergyl plays Rachel, a girl with similiar powers to Carrie (played by Sissy Spacek, her debut movie) and things start to get a little out of control. Amy Irving, one of the only survivors of the first film reprises her role as Sue Snell, something which kept me watching (unfortunately) Very predictable, which should have turned out to be a made for Tv movie. A disgrace to Stephen Kings line of best sellers. Before I go, let me ask this question? Why do people create sequels to King's bestsellers? I've said enough....",157

It has maps of specific countries with the locations of the hotels it describes on the map. This is really useful when you are travelling (in a car) around as opposed to just staying in one city or two. I agree with another reveiwer that the hotels/inns/palaces with pictures are generally better than entries without a picture. Sometimes the website for the establishment will be listed. One caveat... as many countries in Europe now use the euro for currency, you may have to do some math as the prices listed are in former currencies... but the ""star rating"" system will give you a rough idea.",133

I can't give it more than two stars though. I suggest the people who package this mix try another recipe, because the world needs a better low-carb bread mix.",85
0,Not happy!,Radio was working fine. Great reception. Then I plugged in my earbud I found that the sound was only coming in to one ear. I thought it was my earbuds but I tried a different set and verified it was the radio. Great shipping! I had the radio for about 2 wks before I checked so the box and rcpt. had been thrown away.,64
0,The worst commercial software I have ever purchased,ScanSoft PaperPort 11I upgraded to this software. Previous versions were working OK. This is a disaster. It crashes every few minutes. It won't uninstall & trying to remove it is very difficult. It's like crab grass on you computer. Unless Nuance overhauls this product & sends previous users a free replacement I will never purchase from them again.,58
1,Eye Opening Book About Jim Crow South,"I was brought up in the rural Louisiana south in the 50's. I always wondered about the ""White Only / Colored Only"" signs, but never knew until I read this book that they were the result of LAWS and not just local custom. The book is factual but interesting. I came away with a lot better realization of how our society was back then. I gave a copy to my brother; he likewise appreciated the book and found it very informative.",81
1,100 Words or Less,"At first, it's a struggle to know what's going on ... certainly complicated by a brilliant physicist and paranoid killer main character. No spoiler: this is in the first few pages.However, keep at it, go with the flow, and it comes together. When that happens, the beauty of Harrison's universe becomes apparent in its weird multi-dimensional glory.This initial confusion is part of the experience, expected from good hard sci-fi. This world is not easily explained. It's not very pleasant. Yet in the end, this is a good novel with some amazingly written passages.",93
1,"Enjoyable and witty, well written","I grew up in Queens, NY and listened to Chris and Mike on WFAN from 1994 to 2007. Chris can stir up all kinds of emotions and was definitely the most charismatic of the two. I really enjoyed this book and continue to enjoy it. Reviewers on here who gave it 1 star have totally missed the point. Of course it is subjective, it is supposed to be. I loved Chris's choice of Mariano Rivera as the 10th greatest baseball player of all time. It is even hard to argue with Shaq cracking the top 10 of NBA players. Chris is a tremendous sports fan with a great knowledge of sports. I totally enjoyed this book.",116
1,Rare example of a stellar band in concert.,"Forget the naysayers who complain about the recording quality or a mistake or two by the musicians here. This is an energetic,superb and sadly,rare example of Manfred Mann's Earth Band in concert in the 1970's. There are numerous bootlegs floating around out there that may indeed show the band on better nights, but this is the only show that is available officially. The interplay between the musicians is excellent and the energy is almost visible through the speakers for this show. MMEB were (and still are) a severely underrated and overlooked band. Radio shows like this should have broken them to a much bigger audience, by displaying their extraordinary musical chops far exceeded the public's perception that they ""just covered other people's songs"". Buy this if you're interested in a real band, who can play their instruments and improvise in a live setting. You won't be disappointed.",147
0,Item received different than the one ordered,"I am very displeased with the item that I recieved. I searched carefully to find the proper replacement flap for my pet door. I could not find it in Canada, so went to online and checked the specs carefully, and ordered based on the picture and specs provided. I have ended up with a flap that is too small for the pet door, and not the one shown in the picture. Consequenly I have 1/4 to /1/2 inch gap on the sides, where the outside air is free to come and go as it pleases. I am going to have to buy a whole new door. Very disappointed.",108
1,"Get this album, the ORIGINAL, not the ""remastered"" crap","This is the Stormblast you want if you're gonna get the album. No it doesn't have a DVD with it, but big deal. To put out a ""remastered"" version of the album later on was a stupid idea, plain and simple. This is the original, a classic Black Metal masterpiece. I also recommend Dissection's ""Storm Of The Light's Bane"" album for who might not have it already.Hail to the Black!",70
0,Be Careful ...,"I bought this waffle iron from Macys. While the waffles were good, the iron itself was really cheap feeling. There are a lot of plastic parts that do not seem to do the job. When rotating the iron 180 degrees, the plastic latch did not lock. There is a blue light that is supposed to indicate when the waffle is done ... this did not work for me. So ... be careful. I was skeptical that this would last any great length of time, and so I returned it.",89
1,"An Absolute ""Must-Read"" for All interested in Computers","I read this book for my Information Networks and Networking class. Our instructor wanted to see how complex the cyber community is and how easy it is for someone to trapaise through the networks to explore databases and websites of others. And how easy it is to destroy the trust that is expected from everyone participating in that community. Cliff Stoll shows the potential danger of hackers. He also points out the advantages and disadvantages of not securing your systems. We are open books when we decide to participate on the Web, our privacy and safety are challenged.I found ""The Cuckoo's Egg"" to be a quick read and very informative. Since I am not a technical person, I found the language that Cliff Stoll used, to demystify the realm of computers, very easy to follow. I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good spy/ mystery/ thriller and loves computers.",151
0,Gabels LIme,"It's fair, not great. Initial aroma is strong artificial lime, kind of like a Lime Life Saver. This aroma fades pretty quickly. The stuff is fairly refreshing to use, a pretty good bracing feel when you splash it on. After the artificial lime essence fades, the remaining aroma is mild and kind of chemically. I was hoping for mare with this product, it's inexpensive compared to other lime aftershaves-now I know why.",72

0,Todd Bridges comeback?,"First, there is no ""army"" of the dead. There is only one Hispanic family who becomes zombies after being murdrered.Second, Todd Bridges only has a small role as a retarded man with fake buck-teeth and a ""pillow"" or balloon under his shirt to make him look chubby. This is by far the worst and the silliest and the most misleading zombie movie that I have ever seen. Buy this at your own risk. Of course, I rate this movie with one star.Maybe there is a worse zombie movie, but, I can't imagine any film being that much worse than this waste of time and money for the movie buyer and the producers of this nonesense.Bad special effects along with a korny script make this actually painful to watch. I believe this horror movie is even worse than ""The Church""!I thought that movie was the worst horror ever made-I was sadly mistaken",151
0,"Seriously, do yourself a favor and skip it!","I'm a fan of Kinley MacGregor's work. Love the ""Master"" series and the Brotherhood of the Sword books are great. The author stated that she interrupted her Brotherhood of Sword series because she was ""inspired"" to write this instead. Unfortunately inspirational isn't a word i could use to describe this. The descriptive words that DO come to mind include: trite, insipid, maladroit, and rudimentary. Considering the effort the author obviously put into coming up with the world in which this novel takes place, one would think she'd have put SOME effort into the plot This book was a real let down. Or rather a real put down, as i put it down half way through and couldn't bring myself to pick it back up. Do yourself a favor and skip it.",131
1,nice saw but dusty,"I read all the reviews on this saw that i could find, most of which was positive. I had been considering one for some time so I finally retired my 10 yr old trouble free delta bench top for this. I do remodel work for a living and cleanliness is very important to clients, theres the problem..... I love the saws accuracy, power, soft start. but it is the worst saw for dust collection i've ever owned or used in 30 years of work. I read the reviews on this problem but figured it couldn't be that bad, wrong. It throws dust at you from the blade , out the slot for the bevel adjustments, the sides, every where....not good,definitely a outdoors saw. Not sure what the solution is...open to Ideas. time will tell if it will affect the plastic lowering and raising gears...hope not",145

0,I am hurt to say this,"Let me start by saying I loved Teatro, Red-Headed Stranger, Shotgun Willie, Spirit, and his ""greatest hits"" records that I've heard. Unlike a lot of folks, I found plenty to like on Across the Borderline, too. THIS album, however, doesn't measure up. It's thoroughly overproduced, with guitar work and instrumental work utterly overwhelming the subtle joy of Willie's voice and always satisfying guitar playing. The production is like pop country, and I can only say I bought it on my feelings about his other material. He always changes the feel from record to record, which I like, but now and again you're going to fall on your face with that: so here's the tumble, let's hope the next one works. Sorry Willie, but I'd advise people to stay away from this one.",132
0,All About Stalking And Being A Stupid Movie,"Oh my how awful this movie was, I was cringing from start to finish, Sandra acted like she was in a 60's beach movie and it made this a total wipeout.For those who thought Speed 2 was oscar material, all others beware.",42
1,"Great variety, great cardio, great instruction","Sometimes there's nothing like a good, pure cardio workout, which you'll get with this DVD, along with other benefits. Violet Zaki's kickboxing/martial arts will sneak in some toning, and the cardio bursts in Kimberly and Kendall's workouts will get you some added burn. Rob Glick's workout is a bit more challenging as far as choreography, but not overly demanding physically, and Gay Gasper's is good, old fashioned aerobics. You can't go wrong here. I'll admit the propel plugs are annoying, but it was probably necessary to fund production. Each workout is roughly 30 minutes, so you can mix and match depending on what your goals are. There's something here for everyone.",111
0,"Nice, but can't be used for 10K steps","I wanted a pedometer that I could use to count my daily steps, in order to reach 10K steps a day, as recommended for general fitness. I chose this model because I wanted a wristwatch-style pedometer. Unfortunately, the step counting feature cuts off if you sit down for over 30 minutes. I called Tech4O's customer service department, and there is no way around this issue. So I'll be returning the item.",71
1,Really good book on being funny,"As a stand-up comedian, I thought this was a great book that dissects all the necessary ingredients on being funny. It also categorizes the types of funny stuff. But this book is way longer than it should be and the last couple of chapters excluding the advice from pros, are totally redundant. Some people are borned funny that they don't really need to read this. I believe I am one of these people, but it is interesting to see that I am using these techniques without myself even realizing it.",90
1,"Great, but something's missing...","I just got this book, looked it over and am really excited about it. Very unique recipes that I haven't seen anywhere. However, I was discouraged in one recipe, ""Brown Rice Risotto,"" because it tells you to ""dissolve yeast,"" but there's no yeast listed in the list of ingredients. I'm assuming I found the only recipe with a problem. All in all, I can't wait to make the recipes!",69
1,Go Spidey Go!,"After seeing the superhero films of the summer this one crushes them all. Bat-man had so many holes it was boring. Avengers was great but mostly from the build up not the story.

0,"First time it loses charge, never charges again.","I bought one of these a couple years ago and was excited to have a flashlight that ""has no batteries to replace! just wind to charge"". Unfortunately what I and many users have found, was that once the internal battery is discharged, no amount of cranking would ever charge it again. Yes you could crank it and it would light, but it would not hold a charge for more than a few seconds. If the internal batter should not be fully discharged, then there should have been circuitry to prevent that from happening. There are a number of reviews on various sites that complain about this issue. I don't know if newer models have fixed this or not.The emergency flasher is not very useful.The crank handle does not lock into the main body and tends to flop around.The unit seems to be made of fairly sturdy plastic and should not be damaged by normal wear including short drops.",158
0,heavyhanded jung,"This book attempts to marry jungian psychology,eastern religion and a bit of Christian mysticism and fails dismally.The plot is totally disjointed, jumping from pre-war Vienna to wartime Europe to India to Israel and back to India with very little connection in the plot. The characters are wooden and it is impossible to feel any empathy for any of them, even when they are being burned to death or being cruelly blinded. When I read bits out to my family they thought it was a spoof and laughed.",87

1,DANDY LYNN MERIDETH,"No, not Dandy Don- Lynn Merideth is dandy on his own merits. Fabulous vocalist brings life to the Livgren tunes. The Livgren tunes are not as crisp as their previous effort but still pretty good. Livgren is always worth listening to but he's even better with a good vocalist such as Dandy Lynn Merideth and Steve Walsh. Proto Kaw is keeping the 70's spirit alive and well. Keep up the great work Kerry- we love it! How ironic it is that Kansas is once again about to release yet another compilation album...this is silly. I'm glad that Kerry continues to write vibrant, progressive music!!! WAKE UP KANSAS!!!!!",107

0,LONG!,"This movie is long and boring! Did they really need an hour before anything interesting happens? This isn't exactly an epic or anything. Its suppose to be an action popcorn fest based on a board game. This movie should have been 90-100 minutes in length, not 130!!!! I was just bored, waiting for the good times to roll. Even when the movie should have ended, it just kept on going! Jump to about the 65 minute mark, and you will be good to go.",84
1,What a great memory game,"I'd purchased this memory game for my 4 year old. I didn't want any goofy little pictures on them, I wanted something she could easily recognize. The animals, bugs, etc are very cute- for any age and gender. There are lots of different cards so the older kids can play, and you can just pick a few of them to play a smaller game with the little ones. I really enjoy playing this with my daughter and hopefully we'll have years worth of fun!",84

The kids love them!",64
0,Not sure what the hype is about,"I am a young adult lit fan as well as vampire storylines...but I quit reading this book less than half way through, and I almost never quit a book, even if I'm not thrilled with it. I kept waiting for it to go somewhere, but it never did. I slowly realized this was a kid's book and wouldn't have the vivid storylines I was used to. Then, I started thinking about the fact that Harry Potter, technically YA lit, was full of plot.I'm not exactly sure what the hype is all about with this series, but the freshman effort left me cold and I'm not willing to give the other books my time or money.",115
0,Not Worth It,"The sound quality is not good. I used it once and couldn't take the poor audio. I bought this because the cheaper one I bought previously had poor sound quality, but this more expensive one is no better.

0,Motor burned up within a month,"I purchased this ""professional quality"" blender at Target a month ago. I have only used it for smoothies (frozen banana cut into thirds, frozen strawberries, frozen blueberries, frozen spinach, milk, peanut butter--no ice) a couple times per week. This morning, mid-blend, the motor sounded strained, emitted a smoky odor, and I saw light reflecting from the motor onto my kitchen counter. Then, it stopped working completely!! It will not turn on any more.I am very disappointed in the life-span of a blender that I paid a reasonable price for expecting it to last for years. The carafe is a nice, heavy glass, solid and easy-to-use parts, easy to clean. But...The motor should last for at least the warranty period of 5 years, not 1 month. Not acceptable.",127
1,A third way,"This book is carefully thought out and very conservative. The author was looking for, and found, a third way of looking at the issues of men's and women's roles in ministry. Her discussion of preconceptions and expectations was compassionate and thorough. She also used the rules of hermeneutics to dig deep into 1 Timothy 2 and other passages to provide a fresh perspective. This is an important book that men and women who care about ministry where the focus is on Christ as the source and guide should carefully read and prayerfully consider.",93
1,Making and Customizing Doll House Fittings,"The directions given in this book for making and customizing the various items displayed in the book are very clear. The materials list is handy and complete. A wide range of items is included, from tiling floors to plastic casting for ceiling decoration, with furniture and accessories to fill the rooms in between those customized floors and ceilings.Using this book, you can make the basic furniture, or customize ready-made pieces with gilt, paint, or upholstery. There are also directions for creating and re-creating accessories, such as lamps, mirrors, picture frames, etc. Or you can create smaller accessories, such as pots, bowls, or fruit.If you like (or can do) needlework, draperies, rugs, cushions, and upholstery are possible.Overall, the book provides a very good 'how-to' for various aspects of finishing and furnishing a dollhouse. With a little imagination, many of the ideas in this book can be adapted to your style of decor.",151

0,Adequate but not great,"The basic life story of Valentino is told, but it is the telling that is off-putting. A curious style of unscholarly writing together with the misuse of terms (e.g., ""hoi polloi"" is used to refer to the ""elite"" when in fact it means the ""common"") detracts from the narrative. And, as to one of the persisting questions regarding Valentino's sexual orientation, her descriptions of his relationships is at odds with her conclusions. Not the definitive text this subject needs.",79

The lyrics are so inspiring and both guitar players and bass player all do lead vocals throughout the CD..making a mix of vocals so you don't get tired of the same voice! The songs are so awesome that this has to become a definite hit. Go Get this and you will NOT regret it! Midtown has played with bands like the Get Up Kids, FENIX TX already, and are moving on up.

0,It's a book for ignorant people.,"I've bought it only to know what it was written on it. The progression described has the same probability of success of whatever progression you can create by your own. It's written: "" ...lucks runs in streaks"", "" A player cannot afford bad luck for very long..."", "" ...raise the bet as we win."". Luck doesn't exist!!! The probability to win every hand is always the same: it can change ( ""condition"" it by what you know) only counting cards, so probability of success is conditioned. We are in 2005, and still believe in luck!!! ahahahahah! There are only two thing: probability and casuality. If you play knowing probability to win, ""probably"" you will win in the long run. There aren't any miracle progression. This book isn't scientific. It has only a summarised version of basic strategy, some useless progressions, and a little usefull money management... dont buy it... Bye bye",151
1,Excellent!,"I admit that I purchased this CD just for the Reginald Gardiner track ""Trains"", but a few replayings have convinced me that it is a little gem!A good selection of tracks, mostly from the 1940's era, but with some big names like Duke Ellington, Lonnie Donegan, Glen Miller, Tommy Dorsey, and the ever-saucy George Formby, all with a Railroad / Railway theme.If you've old enough to remember riding on a steam train, and have fond memories of the ""Old Days"", then this CD will fit nicely into your library.A winner!",90

0,Reluctant two stars,"I gave it two stars, reluctantly, because despite the libertarian politico-economic spouting of some of the characters, and the tired back and forth across centuries, the first half or so of the book at least had some suspense and (slow and creaky) character development, and an expectation of an exciting and interesting denouement. But by the end I was left sitting there thinking, ""That's it? That's it?!""All along I kept thinking that there had to be something about the object of the search other than its simple existence. Why otherwise would one side try so valiantly to find it, and the other side so desperately to keep it hidden. Why, indeed? I'm still wondering...Pass this one up. I've been a fan of Poul Anderson's for a long time, but some of his latter-day stuff just isn't up to it. This is one fine example.",144
1,DLO TransDock micro,"The Transdock Micro is a good choice to consider for FM transmitters. It transmits a strong, clear signal that doesn't dissapoint. Like all FM tansmitters, it succumbs to interference at some point but quickly recovers as you drive away from the source of interference or quickly retune the Micro to a new station. Users will also find that the Micro is also similar to other FM transmitters in that you have to turn your radio volume higher than you would for a regular radio station. To me, the Micro seems to fit REALLY tight into the cigarette lighters or auxillary power jacks in vehicles. You have to be careful to grab the collar on the Micro when you pull it out so as not to damage it. I used to carry an Ipod charger and transmitter with me on road trips but now my Micro does both. Overall, I am satisfied with my Micro and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality FM transmitter.",166

1,Great stuff,"There is some great stuff on this album. ""Anybody Seen My Baby"" is great, ""Too Tight."" I actually didn't like ""Out of Control"" very much, until I saw the Stones perform it brilliantly on the No Security tour. ""Saint of Me"" is one of the best compositions they've ever done...but, there is that lack of a sloppy Stones feel to it. It wasn't until I looked at the musicians credits for the song that I understood WHY it lacks that feel: Keith Richards does not play on it! Well, you are missed on that song, Keith. It's still a good song. But it would have been brilliant if he'd been on it. (Although the Stones are capable of playing great rock without Keith. He didn't play on the song, ""It's Only Rock and Roll"" either.) Anyway, there are good slow songs on this, too. Unless you are one of those people stuck in the past, who refuses to like any new Stones music, I think you'll like this album.",169

Even if she did it wouldn't make the songs sound any better since the rest of the her songs are just flavorless. The songs maybe a bit catchy, but it's still boring. Her voice isn't too wonderful either. I think she tried too hard to sound older and stretch her voice.",82
0,This NO Loving Annabelle!,"With the high expectation of chemistry between the two main characters like those in Loving Annabelle, I was sadly disappointed. They sought no friendship before the teacher takes her home to bed - a scene void of intimacy, romance and skin. I watched it once and was so disappointed I immediately threw it away deeming it a HUGE waste of money. If you are looking for romance or chemistry, look elsewhere.",71
0,permatex windshield repair,"This product failed to repair my bullseye damage on my windshield. I don't believe that the resin ever reached the cracks. It looked just the same as it did before the repair. I used some other product several years ago on a similar bullseye with outstanding results. The repaired area looked like no damage had ever occurred. I believe the problem with the Permatex product is that the resin is too thick to be pulled into the cracks, even after creating the vacuum. The resin needs to be very low in viscosity and low in surface tension to flow into the crack. If the resin never flows into the crack, the crack will always show. I called Permatex and they said that maybe the product was old, so I went back to Auto Zone and they gave me my money back. I wish I could remember the brand of product I used several years ago when I had such good results. The resin was water thin and required several hours in the sun to cure but it was definately worth it.",181

1,Edelman's solid!,"I previewed dozens of books and web sites before selecting two or three references to develop a course for my employer on Personal Finance for a New Millennium. I hold a degree in Business Education but I was rusty.I selected Edelman's book to focus much of my pilot program on...and the pilot went extremely well. To make a long story short, I presented the training program about 70 times and requests for it are still coming in on a regular basis. My training was ""mandatory"" so, at times, I had hostile members in the audience. Edelman's work held up to some tuff scrutiny.If you are in the market for an excellent, to the point, book on personal finance, get your hands on ""the truth about money."" The tone of the book is conversational and down to earth. Edelman strikes a great balance here. The book is a very enjoyable read.",150
0,worse HP ever,"Over the years I have always purchased HP Laser printers for my business. This is the third generation, and one would think that they would improve, but not in this case. I have never had so many problems with a printer in my life. I have 2 of these running (and i use that term loosely) on a Mac and Vista. They both constantly hang up and I have to power them off and then on. HP support said I needed more memory, but my previous HPs with less memory never had 10% of the problems that these do. It is because of this printer that I have had to install ""Baseball bat free zone"" stickers around my computer. Otherwise they would have been trashed. This is my first review ever, but with the frustrations I have had with this printer - I couldn't not rate it. If there was a zero choice, I would have picked it and even that would have been generous.",165
0,Underwhelming based on the previous reviews,"Upon reading this book, my opinion is that the author is trying to glorify the stereotype of a ""wallflower"". The character is sensitive and introverted but in the book, those qualities are met with understanding and acceptance which to me seems unrealistic. It has been my experience that inviduals who exhibit these qualities in real life tend to be lonely or exist on the outskirts of their respective social circles due to the fact that sadly, very few people realize the depth that such individuals possess.In my opinion, the book reads like the fantasy of one such person in which everyone recognizes that the main character is intelligent and special and the things he says profound. I suppose in that respect, the book lives up to its title. However, as with most fantasies, the narrative of the story has a very limited perspective and the characters and events are too one-dimensional to be believable.",154

1,An excellent guide for parents,"This little gem highlights the importance of self-quieting skills and independent play skills. In it you discover that how you interact with your child during the daytime has enormous effect on nighttime behaviors and as well as many self control behaviors occurring away from home. These two skills are so underestimated in much of the parenting literature and even the child psychology literature for professionals. Although lacking in detailed examples of what the author means by these behaviors, there is enough description to come away with a better understanding. The parent handouts at the end are very good and the time out one is particularly good. The book is a little outdated but is an easy read.",117
1,Van the Man...,"Not ""Too Late To Stop Now"", but awesome for a collaborative effort.

Definitely worth picking up for any Van fan.",51
0,Bad design,"I liked the looks of this valve but the holes where the water comes out are way too small and decreased the water pressure and flow too much.The bigger issue is that the sliding valves did not fully shut off and when opened, they automatically closed half way due to the water pressure.

1,"One season, so far so good","We used the toro to shred a lot of leaves for composting. And I do mean a lot. It took a while, but we expected that. If the bag had been bigger or the collection system that we purchased separately had worked better we would have been even more satisfied.When the vacuum picks up a small stick, there is a definite sound as if the blade hit a rock. There is no avoiding that. Our only question is ""will the blade last through many seasons, or will those hits shorten the life so that we are, in the end, dissatisfied. We'll see.For the blower alone, so far so good.",109

1,Hawiian Vacation?,"(A kid's review) I liked this book overall, except for the fact that the baby-sitters wanted to tow Dawn along on that school Hawaii trip- and she was on their side. I felt terrible for Dawn's mom- all she wanted to do was spend time with her daughter and WHOOSH! back to the west coast goes Dawn, without a care in the world about how her mother feels. There's even a paragraph in the story that goes like this: A trip to Hawaii? I'd already flown clear across the country. I'd been looking foreward to a nice, relaxing New England summer. Did I really want to go back out West so soon? You bet I did!That is terribly cruel and makes Dawn sound like a snobby brat without one care about her mother's feelings. This book WILL frustrate you in parts.",141
1,A problem concept but well delivered,"I think with ""Building Harlequin's Moon"" and ""Ringworld's Children"" Larry Niven has finally returned, putting behind him the horrid 1990s where he wrote one uninspired, confusing, and convoluted book after another. ""Building Harlequin's Moon"" is not on the same level as ""Ringworld"" or ""The Mote In God's Eye,"" but it is a fine book and an enjoyable, quick read.As others have said, one of the things that holds the book back is the basic premise that only by creating a race of slaves, can the colonists save themselves. It doesn't ring true and nags at the back of your mind as you read the book. But putting this aside and going with the premise, we have great Niven characters on an interesting world. There is a point about a quarter of the way through the book when something is done to one of the main characters that just infuriates the reader. I knew when I got that mad, that I was hooked on ""Building Harlequin's Moon.""",166
0,Very disapointing,"Since watching the Reanimator films and loving them, I have taken to reading stories by H.P. Lovecraft and I can only wonder what he would have thought of this movie. While scary and gory, it seemed rather intelectually shallow, unlike Lovecraft's written work. I kind of liked the wimpy hero here as he seemed like the type of everyman so prominent in Lovecraft's stories, however the ending just left me empty. It was contrived and poorly done. Where did the tentacles come from? Dagon was supposed to be some kind of fish god or at least that's what I understood. There may have been some other technical problems like the car starting after the wires were ripped out and gills on people in different areas of their bodies but I could live with that. Sorry, but this one just was not enjoyable.",142
0,"Nice looking pot, but way too fragile","The first pot was broken when i opened the box. I did not think anything of it, as accidents happen during shipping. So i returned it and got another one(super fast, A+ for amazon returns department). We used it for several days and were really liking it, other than it can be hard to clean depending on the size of the tea you are brewing, as the slits can get clogged. Then one day i was washing the strainer and it tipped over and shattered. I did not drop it on the floor, it simply tipped over while drying and broke. I had a feeling this would happen, because as soon as we took it out of the box i was thinking how fragile the pot looked. This would be a good pot if the glass was thicker, but as it is it is way too thin, both the pot and the strainer. I would look elsewhere for a thicker pot if you need a glass one.",167
1,Just another good band,"Godsmack is not the greatest band, Godsmack isnt one of my favorite bands, and Godsmacks cds arent the greatest either. But the one thing that elevates Godsmack above most bands is the fact that they are an ""mtv band"" and have stayed true to their sound on every cd. True their sound has changed a little bit but only because they have matured as musicians. This isnt the greatest cd but it is definitly worth having in any metal/hard rock collection.",81

0,Love/Hate Timer,"I have 3 of the Presto Timers. I gave one to my daughter and kept the other two. At first I loved this timer with its programming features and great alarm sound. In no time the hate began as I had to push the buttons so hard to get them to work. Sometimes I pushed them sideways and more softly and eventually got what I wanted to came up. Then it hopped all around to the other items, like the date, time, hour, minutes, seconds. I had to push away to make it stop. The only thing that worked well was the clock. Used one timer for my diabetes testing and shots and the other acted the same. Since my medications are pretty much controlled by the clock I cannot rely on this timer and am currently shopping for another. Too bad, Presto is a well known brand.",148
1,Marc Cohn once again dazzles with a show of skill and heart.,"Marc Cohn followes up his self-titled debut album with this well crafted collection. Mr. Cohn shows his vast musical knowledge by dabbling with various genres of music, including some folk sounds reinforced with the unexpected sound of a Wurlitzer organ. Listen closely to the title track for the unmistakable Bonnie Raitt guitar harmonies. 'Medicine Man' carries some intriguing literary references, and spotlights some southern influence. 'The Things We've Handed Down' is an excellent example of this artist's ability to access and identify the factors which play on the human condition. In this touching lullaby to his unborn son, Mr. Cohn shows he has a rare ability to mix incredible songwriting skill with vulnerable and emotional elements. I really enjoyed the diversity displayed on this album, and it has become one of my own personal favorites. I hope that his works get more of the recognition they deserve.",147

Contrary to what the reviewer who positively used this item stated, we DID use the pre-stain treatment recommended by Minwax and still had a terrible time with this stain. It is incredibly splotchy despite multiple different techniques we used to apply it. I had a feeling this product was too good to be true, and I was right. I would highly recommend taking the extra time and money to buy a can of good quality stain and a can of sealant. It is well worth it to not attempt to make this shortcut.",104

1,excellent Belgian prog,"As a Canterbury-style prog fanatic I had to check this band out and they did not disappoint.They have great rhythm section with jazzy keyboard and tasteful/soulful guitar playing.The vocals by Pascal Son(female) are staccato and high-pitched and act as an addtional instrument.The melodies are very catchy and melodious in the Canterbury style.In addition there are four bonus tracks by the previous incarnation called Classroom.On one of the tunes Son sings in French as fast as she can,kind of like doing vocal scales,but it works. Classroom were much less prog and more jazz.All the tracks on the Cd are from 1973 and 1974.Their second CD called ""Viva Boma"" is worth checking out also.It's more subdued and has a Matching Mole sound",120

0,The weakest in the Angelina series,"In ""Angelina's Baby Sister"", the arrival of baby sister Polly has Angelina resorting to temper tantrums and bad behavior to get her parents' attention. I felt this was the weakest of all the books in the Angelina series due to a number of reasons: the adults seem to ignore Angelina without reassuring her from the beginning, Angelina says some very harsh words about her baby sister and uses the word ""hate"" which I deem too harsh for my preschooler to hear [she has no real concept of what the word means as she hardly ever hears it used], and in the end Angelina throws a full-scale temper tantrum, destroying her room in order to vent her anger which also seems a bit extreme.My 4-year-old and I love the books in the Angelina series and it's too bad that this particular book was written without too much thought put into it. The others in the series are much better, but if you're new to the series, you may want to skip this.",171

Ivah must quickly ""grow up"" and leave her teenage life behind her. The book is filled with different aspects, including, love, sex, and family.

And at the center of this story is Russell, an earnest and goofily likeable man whose desire to build rockets and be a part of humanity's journey into space is matched only by his desire to connect to the humans that surround him. It's hard not to root for him as he travels across the globe in pursuit of the stars, all the while struggling to make sense of soldiers, engineers, rockets and relationships.Especially impressive for a first novel, hopefully more to follow...",116

0,A Fancy Pot Boiler,"There's a big hole in the center of this book where the personality of the protagonist ought to be. It seems that the author, after having spent time in a German think-tank and needing to mine some gold out of it, hobbled together a novel from his impressions of Berlin, to which he added an incredibly thin plot revolving around the crisis of his 60ish film-making hero. The writing is very, very pretty, but not always clear. Sentences don't just run on but run amok. Everone talks alike. The action, what there is of it, is poorly motivated. There are numerous digressions, while seeming essentials are absent. The saving grace is what one learns about political and cultural thinking in today's re-unified East Germany.",124

0,Could have done better myself!,"I gave this tribute two stars and only because the songs are Aaliyah remakes. Why weren't there people singing these songs that could actually sing? Why don't these songs have music that sounds like the original? I feel as if I could have done this project in my home basement with a karaoke machine. One thing I do like about the CD is the tracks that were used. It was a good choice of songs. Actually they used almost all of my favorites. However, anyone planning on getting this CD, keep your money. From what I know, this project is not suppported by Aaliyah's record company or any of those close to her. Hardcore Aaliyah fans, just wait, cause word has it that Blackground(her company) is releasing a greatest hits CD. Waiting patiently with ya'll, remember babygirl truly was ""One In A Million"".",143

I was expecting this to have some entertaining examples of smart people falling for intellectual fads and some insights as to how that happens. Unfortunately, no such luck. All of the examples are ones that are widely known and there is really no insightful analysis. The book is quite short - all of the interesting content would barely fill a New Yorker article - and one gets the impression that this was just put together over a few weekends. I would have to say that the content is uniformly at the junior high school level. Save your money, no entertainment or enlightenment here.",116
1,Very nice small compressor,"Works very well for small jobs. Recharges extremely fast. Needed at least 6CFM at 90psi and this was the smallest, most affordable compressor I could find. Larger tank would obviously be better, but that would defeat the purpose of the small easy to move/store package.I haven't used it for big jobs yet, but I'm sure it will be fine. It will be interesting to see how it does for sprinkler blowout next year. Based on other reviews, it seems like it will do ok, just need to blow out zones several times. The small footprint and easy movability is great.Delivered with the requisite bent wheel, but it's fine. The cord storage, small storage box and foldability is great.",118

1,"A book easy to follow, apply, and make use of...","I have a number of books on Feng Shui, and this is easily the most accessible. It is written clearly, provides concrete examples, and the reasoning behind doing certain things is explained properly. In other books I have on the subject, a lot of time is spent dealing with the more arcane aspects of Feng Shui, which many of us do not need or want.This book is practical and easy to use, and its format allows one to walk around the house carrying it and applying its suggestions without having to take volumnous notes and study for days. If you want to bring order to your life, stimulate the flow of ""chi"" (energy) through your home, and make it a happier, brighter place (and your life better at the same time), this is the book to help you.

So eager, as a matter of fact, that when Amazon informed me they were unable to get Sign and ABC, I logged onto the company's website and ordered it directly from them (ten dollars more expensive than with Amazon).I can definately see where someone would think this video is creepy or strange. The main song was meant to sound like a folk song, but didn't quite come off right, and the sound quality is poor.A few of the children signing don't smile at all, either glaring at the camera or looking very apathetic. It's not fun to watch at all.",116
1,the start of something big,So this one is really good. it starts to pick up and you get some hints on what is to come.

By the time I was allowed to see what I paid for, I was so irritated, that I could not enjoy the program.Next night, I tried to watch episode two. But, it tried to force me to watch all the advertisements again. At least the ""Open"" button worked. The only way to watch this ****, is to insert it before fixing supper.

1,"An informative, well-written treasure trove","This is a fantastic book. I especially loved chapter 5, where the author pulled together a lot of findings from diverse sources (research, biology, religion, philosophy) to present a compelling case for how those who seek to attain happiness through consumerism and achievement are misguided. Instead, he makes a compelling case for finding happiness in relationships, savoring everyday moments, finding diverse, enjoyable experiences, etc. Chapter 7 is also amazing. Who wouldn't want to erase all stress and misfortune from our loved ones lives? Yet, he makes a strong case for the importance of trauma in defining an identity and thriving.",100

After reading about 40% of the book, I again went online and bought myself a paperback copy so that I could carry it with me wherever I go. I know that this will be a book I read over and over again. A great quote from this book, which I believe summarizes what this book does, is: ""knowledge isn't power until it is applied; and the purpose of this book is not to tell you something new. The purpose of this book is to remind you of what you already know and to kick you in the shins and inspire you to do something about applying it.""",133

0,Absurd approach for a beginner,"This software uses an absurd approach. They play a long sentence for you and then don't give you the phonetic pronunciation in English in writing. Instead they give you the pronunciation in devanigri (Hindi) script. This is completely useless for someone who can't read Hindi. And they don't teach you the script either.Completely useless approach and frustrating for a newcomer. The Japanese version of Rosetta stone had English phonetics with the Japanese audio, and that was ten years ago. I don't know why they didn't stick with that approach for Hindi. The only think I can think of is that they messed up when producing this software and were too cheap to correct the problem.I also own Japanese, Mandarin, and Spanish versions of Rosetta Stone, but I'm about to switch to Total Immersion for my fiance because I've had enough of this crap frustrating her.",145
0,Instruction book is worthless and phone support is $$$$$,"As a writer of Novels and Short Stories, I decided to try my hand at a screenplay, using Final Draft 6. BIG MISTAKE! The instruction book assumes you already know how to write a screenplay and never explains the basics. Tech support is very expensive and will cost you more than the price of the software by the time they explain how it works. An instructional video would be helpful, but is not available.My advice would be to not purchase this software unless you know someone who is willing to teach you how to use it. I'm sure it's great for those that already know how to write a screenplay, making it much faster. But for a novice to the trade, it is worthless.",124

The album starts off great a lot of his vintage tunes and includes a few surprises. Jake the Peg (which I hadn't heard before) is worth the price of the album alone! Just a lot of fun, join in and sing along type tunes. The weak spot on the album are a few of the later, slower tracks. Although it works quite well on Sun Arise and the first duet, I'm afraid Rolf's voice just can't carry too many slower songs in a row. I loved Stairway to Heaven and only wish that he would have done the whole song.",119

There are only 6 different terrains to play on and they get old very quickly. Other than that, this game is fantastic. The voice chat is great too.

1,Fun and Challenging,"It's one of those few chances that I've had to read devotional material with a grin on my face and conviction in my heart. As the reader follows the simple journey of the author's faith, he cannot help but yearn for a more simple faith as well. To cry and yearn and question and struggle and think like Don does would be a blessing. To live and learn and grow and change as Don does is equally a challenge. The material will push your buttons no matter what perspective you come from, but the key is to take it for what it's worth. It's one man's experience with God. It's not normative for everyone, but it's nonetheless real. So, sit back, enjoy, and learn much from the delightful little faith-adventures of Don (especially the sexy carrot and the astronaut).",139

The sound quality is excellent, and the flashing lights are bright enough. We love that it has selectable volume (2 levels) as well as 2 different modes of play. My only complaint would be that the legs are only held in by one little screw...one of them pulled through so I had to add a little washer. No big deal really, but washers should have been provided as the screw heads are pretty small. With that being said, she CONSTANTLY climbs, bangs, and pulls on this toy (actually she beats the hell out of it) and it has proven to be very durable despite the undersized screws. This toy was $$ well spent.",148
1,From Ore with love: old but instructive introduction to number theory.,"Pros:1. The book could teach basic number theory to a wide range of readers, from mathematically inclined high-school students to much more advanced lovers of mathematics. 2. It is enlivened by nice historical allusions.3.The author shows and shares his fascination with the subject in the writing.4. On a less lofty side, the font is large enough to avoid eye strain.Cons:1. First published 59 years ago, the book has to be dated. For example, many beautiful applications of number theory had been unknown at the time of writing.2. Not all exercises require creativity, many of them are routine drills.Bottom line:If number theory is not your fortress, the book could strike a balance between enjoyable reading and learning.",116

0,don't buy this carseat,after carefully doing hours of research on car seats i choose this one. i read other peoples reviews and thought that they weren't doing something right. the bottom buckle is like a puzzle peice and when your baby is crying and kicking it's near impossible to get to together. the straps twist too easy and although it's not hard to untwist it's just one extra thing i don't have time for. my son is 4 months old and looks smushed in it. the recline doesn't recline as much as you'd expect. the strap you pull to tighten the harness is near impossible to tug. refacing it hits the back of the seat and you can't pull up on it only out and the seat is in the way. but even with no seat it still doesn't tighten enough for my 4 months old. maybe it would be ok for a 1 yr. old and forward facing but it still needs a lot of time to figure out and adjust. im returning it and playing with every seat out there before i buy another one.,184

1,"Can it be, an honest gambler?","At first, I was upset. John Patrick is offensive and sometimes down-right rude, but after I watched his DVD I realized he's being honest. He doesn't sugar-coat the odds, and tell you ""you're gonna be rich."" He give the facts to you, straight, and teaches why his strategies work. This way you can adapt and mold his stategies to fit your ideas and preferences. After watching that first DVD, I could see how much knowledge John had, and I've been purchasing his DVD's since.",84

She paints a beautiful picture of God pursuing us, captivated by us and the transformation that takes place in US when we let Him make us into the woman He created us to be. She also reminds us of who we are and of the power that we have ""in Christ"".I love the connection that she makes between the Cinderella story and Christ's love for us and our own Cinderella story.",73
1,This CD is high quality material,"I listen to music everyday, whether it comes on MTV, the radio, or even live, at concerts, and take my advice, this band shows big improvement from its previous albums and seems as if new life charged the band through the new waves of vibrant yet, exotic music being exposed to the World every day and this album can be considered one of the Deftones very finest. The song that pursueded my purchase was of course, Change (in the house of flies), but later I discovered more heavier, masterfully written songs such as ""Elite"" and ""Street Carp"", the combination of these three songs makes this album a better purchase along with its other features.",114

1,The Education of a Fox-hunting Man,"Perhaps the best thing about this book is the clear picture it paints of a carefree world in rural England. The story revolves around a young country gentleman and his sport activities, which are mainly cricket and fox hunting. The story makes one long sales pitch, especially during our times of never-ending pressure, for the countryside world described by the author: sunny and beautiful days, cricket, fox hunting, and a cup of fine tea every now and then. The more revealing aspects are what is missing from his world, endless shopping, pressing deadlines at work, traffic jams, and all the ‘gems’ modern life has to offer. This book is not a fast read, and yet still very absorbing.",118

0,their first cd......,"The truth is I really don't like this cd, although, their lyrics are still great, and thier message is still good. Toby sounds like crap (more like a little kid) in this cd, but he is the one that wrote and produced all of the songs. I liked ""spinning 'round"", but most of the songs just sound so weird! Mike is ok, but not as good as a singer as in later cds. Kevin is a terrific singer. They had to start somewhere, I guess. This is back in the day when they were all rap (like their second and most of their third cds). DC Talk is probably one of my favorite, if not favorite, band. Plus, they only have eight songs on this cd. Only recommended if you're in need of a good message.",136
0,What a RIPOFF of a product! Does NOT work! Stay AWAY!,"About six months ago, we bought this product because we heard a lot of good things about it. Well, don't believe everything you hear. Due to a busy schedule raising our first baby, we simply did not get around to using it until recently, and it would not charge! We followed the instructions 'to a T', and the unit would not work at all- not even the low current built-in light. Now, as an electronics buff and Ham Radio operator, I know a thing or two about testing equipment, and when I hooked up a voltmeter, the unit didn't even show a very low level of voltage. The only conclusion I can draw is that this unit is defective and/or poorly engineered, or is not capable of any kind of 'shelf-life' over and above a few months, which is ridiculous. This is my experience with the 'Simple Start'.",148

1,Chief of Mission,"I have read every Griffin book and enjoyed everyone, including ""The Hostage."" But I see indications that the author may be relying on others to write his dialogue. At the least, he is receiving inaccurate research information. To wit, a United States ambassador IS the Chief of Mission in any foreign country. This book would lead you to believe there are differences. Not so. I hope that enough feedback is being provided to Griffin to make him a bit more discrete in using the information provided by his researchers.",89
1,"A few very good, rare tracks","This release looks like a cheap knockoff from the pre-downloading era; the scant track information, cheap graphics and complete absence of liner notes looks very poor in comparison with today's deluxe reissues. Luckily, there are some great, obscure tracks in this series (vols. 1-3) which rightfully rescue them from the bargain bin. ""Savage Lover"" and ""Fear"" are particularly good, but most of this stuff is GAY GAY GAY from back in the day - if you were around in the clubs late 70s/early 80s this will definitely tickle your ears, but if you like melodic (euro)disco with traditional song structures you could do a lot worse.",106

0,Is this really quilting?,"It's a book about using large-scale fabrics and nine-patch blocks placed here-and-there to give some sort of effect. Sorry, but I just don't think this is quilting. Just sloppily putting together fabrics. It's easy to finish these projects in a day because there are not many pieces. The nine-patch blocks are thrown all over the place. It's like either making a cake with a box of Duncan Hines cake mix and canned frosting or making a cake from scratch with home-made frosting that takes time, care, and lots of love. That's true with quilting too. A quilt should be made with time, care and lots of love, not something thrown together like the patterns in this book.",117

Before adding humidity via this attractive steamer we couldn't pet the cat or turn on an appliance without causing a ""spark"" of static electricity. This product does exactly what I purchased it for, and looks good on my black wood-stove. I thought the water would last longer because of the size of the steamer, but when the fire is going full tilt, the bear needs quite a bit of refreshing. IF you burn your stove while you are away, you might want to put the steamer on a cooler part of the stove, if you have one, or remove it to avoid damaging the glaze on the interior.",121

1,How to run an academic department,"Toh Ming Lu clearly discusses the difficult and challenging circumstances under which he became the head of the Physics Department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He then explains his unusual approach for solving the problems that the department was facing. His lessons, based on common sense and shrewd observation of the similarities and differences between academia and the business world and how you can motivate the faculty, staff and students to work harder and work together, are truly worth learning. He succeeded in moving the department to a much higher level, where few could have even managed to keep it from disintegrating. His approach is quite universal and based on a few basic principles that I belive can be applied to many situations. Therefore, I recommend this book not only to academics, but also to many businessmen facing tough problems as they move into the new century.",146

0,Relative distress and Mistrust,"A novel comprised of 319 pages that Cosmopolitan promised would be a ""pool-side page turner"" is anything but and the only real comfort found in reading the novel is that the reader has the power to skip pages. The third person omniscient view made for a drawn out narrative and too much depiction on emotions instead of action. It is very slow paced, almost boring me into submission, however the ending seemed rushed. Good writing, poorly implemented gave meaningless yet influential characters such as Bunny, Alice and Adrian the opportunity to ""fluff"" the novel. It took too much time to get to meat and bones of the story and by the time I got there, my appetite was ruined. The enchantingly cliché ending and impressive storyline almost makes up for the boorish execution of events by uniting a family and banishing the primitive prima donna.",145
0,Disappointing,"I saw a couple of good reviews for this book and thought I was in for a treat...the storyline and plot was a little too much to believe; a genetically engineered talking timber wolf is the ""partner"" for the warlord in question...The author starts to paint an abusive background for the title character Jane, but never really develops it...you are left hanging at the end wondering if her mother is dead or alive.....the sex is very steamy and descriptive, but without a good story it doesn't really help.",88
0,Save your money.,"If you are looking for good military SF, this isn't it. This book and it's sequel were mildly entertaining reads. As a former Infantryman, I found Buettner's writing to be the Walter Mitty daydreaming of another REMF ""wanna-be"". The kind of guys who never had the balls to be in a combat arms unit, but who love talking about their military service.To compare his writing to Heinlein, Drake, or Ringo is to do these men a great disservice as both authors and soldiers. These were men who experienced life at the sharp end, and it shows in their writing.I would advise anyone who is looking for ""authentic"" combat SF to look elsewhere.",112

I have seen pictures from Thunderball and other movies in full color and look spectacular but not in this book.

0,"3 stars average rating, really??","Just a terrible movie. Quite possibly the worst Uma Thurman has been involved in. Rating it on its own merits, it's not that bad of a movie-- just kind of silly and dumb and totally forgettable. Comparing it to the Peel-era shows is what makes this very hard to watch. First of all, Uma Thurman looks nothing like Diana Rigg. Jessica Biel would make a much better Emma Peel. Secondly, this is set in modern day. So much of Peel's persona has to do with how she twirls her flip or wearing those white gloves. Without that hair and clothing goes much of the essence of Emma Peel. Sealing the tomb is a barrage of crappo CGI which makes the whole thing look like the graphics on a fast food cup set to motion. For a dumb film of a similar flavor which actually succeeds at being a comedy, just rent ""Austin Powers"".",153

0,Do not buy this telephone,"I bought my first RAZR in April 2005, and after ten days it completely stopped working. The supplier happily provided me with a replacement, but I am completely unimpressed. I bought it for its Internet capability, but it is unbelievably slow, and essentially useless for things like checking email. The sound quality is very bad; I strain to hear my callers constantly. The inside screen is impossible to see in anything but low light, gets gummed up easily, and the keypad is practically invisible unless you're shining a bright light on it (which makes it impossible to see the screen)! It randomly turns itself off. You can only store the last 10 calls received, instead of the 30+ my old lower-tech phone could. There's a reason why these phones are now being discounted and offered in special deals.",138

Or sometimes it is just plain too expensive and I'm determined to do without. In any case, this book identifies what the ingredient is and suggests a substitute, which is exactly what I need.",102

The first one the motion sensor didn't work: would either go on all the time, or wouldn't go on at all (had nothing to do with my settings- I have a Ph.D.- I am not stupid!), second unit wouldn't work at all, now on third unit and one light works and the other doesn't. Have only had this for 6 months! Of course I put in a new bulb- nothing! What a piece of crap. Looks fancy and sophisticated, but probably put together by monkeys at a zoo!",95

0,Misadventures in Yorkshire..,"""The Silence of Herondale"" is Joan Aiken's first adult novel. From the jacket, you think it will be a whodoneit, but that is misleading. This is more ""watch the young woman avoid danger"" type of books. Basically, the heroine is hired as a governess for a precocious 13 year old girl, who happens to be a famous playwright. Said playwright is tired of writing, and runs away to her uncle in Yorkshire. In the meantime, the playwright meets up with a mysterious cousin named Jeremy, who warns her to ""beware of relations"". Soon, the trio has to avoid ""accidents"", as someone close wants them dead. But who? Is it the aunt who hired the heroine? The cousin? Or is it the ""Slipper Killer"" who is loose about town. Most of the plot twists are predictable with someone being the lost son of someone else, and people not being as they seem. An O.K book.",154
0,Not a good psychological thriller,I thought the outline on the inside cover of the book was more interesting than the book itself.,18
1,A memoir where food is the main character,"Some reviewers here say that as Americans they couldn't relate to this book. Well, not this American. Food is, after all, food. Brit or American we each have a relationship with food that transcends the mere physical (as our ever expanding waistlines would attest). So does the author and this is what he writes about, food...and his memories of it, food...and family, food...and sex. An engaging read from the get go, instantly you are in this book and in the life of little Nigel. Written in 100% Sensory Detail Surround you see what he sees, you feel what he feels, you smell it, taste it. Of course all is told with his customary wit and no holds barred humor. The only drawback to this book? Don't read it if you're on a diet, it will make you hungry.",138
1,"Entertainment, mob-style.",So relaxing. Bob Stack's emotionless Ness is calming even after the most hectic days. And what could be more cathartic then the sounds of the rapid-fire explosions of a machine gun and the berserk smashing of breakables as the bullets land?,41
1,GROOVY!,"I read other reviews that this was a continuation to the evil dead story, and although it does not take place directly after Army of Darkness, it definitely feels like a continuation of the series and it is a really fun read.As someone who has not read comics in quite some time, I found this volume very enjoyable. It was like I was reading an animated sequel to the series! Lines are rehashed from the films but they are used in perfect context to what is going on, and all of the characters are true to their film counterparts. I could definitely see Sam Raimi directing a sequel like this.The illustrations may be a bit more 'cartoonish' than I was expecting, but I think that adds to the humor. If I were to give any criticism is that it was too short!Overall, this a great read - HIGHLY recommended!",149

Ms. Nelson does a fine job of presenting several rather disparate meditation styles from different cultural backgrounds without expressing any particular bias.On the other hand, there's no sense that she found any of these useful or different for her. I would, in fact, feel more comfortable with an entirely scholastic approach rather than this impersonal soft-sell approach.Also, Ms. Nelson seems utterly determined that one can only meditate with an instructor and a group. Bleh on her.",85

Is this a reflection of the author's life? Does he feel depressed? Is he trying to depress others? It was all I could do to continue considering the automotive sales profession let alone keep reading. If I wanted that kind of motivation I could listen to old George Jones songs and drink beer. IF you are looking for training and inspiration I would leave this one on the shelf.",132

1,Extraordinary,"I have sought out and collected European electronic music for 20+ years. Running the gamut from Kraftwerk, through the Giorgio Moroder/euro-disco years, up to the present electronica/techno genre(s). Speaking from a long term & well ballanced education of progressive music, OMD's release ""Architecture and Morality"" comfortably rests within my personal Top 5 All Time Favorites. Furthermore, OMD's follow-up to ""Architecture and Morality,"" [""Dazzle Ships""] also ranks within my Top 5. By todays over-the-top standards, these 2 releases still evoke lovely, pristine atmospheres. Subtlety, sensitivity, and sensibility best describe the genius of this masterwork. Something deep within the strength of ""Architecture..."" has always made me incredibly evocative. Very simply put: this release is luminous; I can't recommend this (or ""Dazzle Ships"") enough.",121
0,Hotel not Worth the Trip,"Rolling Stone was right about this album; listeners are not going to be happy now with this disappointing effort from an artist whose attitude is getting bigger than her talent.

There are so many better artists rising in the ranks these days; Branch better get her act together if she wants to compete for an audience with the likes of Beyonce.",80

The Jamaicans and Indians are inherently better than any white character in this entire book. BORING. Ms. Levy's voice as a Jamaican rings true. Writing as a white woman or man Ms. Levy lacks authenticity. I have read hundreds of books written in the 40s by these ""white racists"" and Small Island seems to be about another planet.",101

The escape from captivitiy scene is nothing more than some guys in ape make-up climbing walls while Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch run back and forth across the screen with No One In Pursuit. This film is really rather dull and not worth the time or money. Its plot line drags and is nothing more than an excuse to show how far make-up effects have come since the original film.",85
0,"Works great on XP-SP3 system, but regular BSOD from driver","The Intel ethernet port on my P4C800-E Deluxe motherboard died, so thought this would give me simple ethernet. Installed easily and got me connectivity quickly, but I started getting regular (about once per day) Blue Screens of Death (BSOD). Couldn't decipher the dumps at first, but then saw they mostly pointed to 8511.SYS which is the driver loaded for this system. Went to the Belkin web site and loaded the latest driver, but the Blue Screens kept happening. Finally gave up and switched to an old PCI-based Ethernet card I was still able to buy. Since this device doesn't even claim to work with Vista, and doesn't work with my fully-updated XP system, I'm guessing you shouldn't trust their driver developers.",121

1,A magnificent CD - time for a Josef Locke revival!,"This magnificent CD and the impression that it appears to have made on so many people gives me motivation to shamelessly shill the late tenor Josef Locke.Josef Locke was the greatest Irish tenor of the 40s and 50s. His recording and concert career was halted during his prime by income tax problems in the early 60s - his last public performance was sometime in the 70s. However, he has never ceased to be less than popular in his homeland - he passed away in October, 1999, aged 82.He left a number of popular recordings - samples are available on Amazon and other sites. Simply search on ""Josef Locke"".Also see the movie ""Hear My Song"", available on video, which encapsulates Josef Locke's career in a really neat story. Ned Beatty is superb as Josef Locke, along with Evan Dunbar and Tara Fitzgerald.If you love this music, please turn your ear to Josef Locke as well!",154
0,"Sad, Sad, Sad","My, how far we've fallen. I remember when this show was sharp, well written and hilarious. Sadly, none of what made the original series so brilliant is on display here. What we get is a plot lifted from earlier, better episodes, secondary characters with nothing to do but make an appearance for nostalgic's sake, and a main character (Patsy) who no longer resembles herself. And it all plays out with nary a laugh in sight. How disappointing! Jennifer Saunders is an undeniable talent, but she seems determined to drag the memory of this once ground-breaking show through the dirt with these senseless ""Specials"". If you absolutely have to see this (and if you're a long time fan, you will feel like you have to), then rent it first. And be prepared to be let down.",135
0,Disappointing,"I excepted more from this movie. The filming was horrible as was the acting. It did start out promising with your first look at the ghost, but other than a few scares it was boring.

0,Void of any real content,"I picked this book up awhile back, it was pretty thick so I looked forward to reading it. Once I got around to it I was pretty suprised. The book lists ever movie Lang made and then gives 4 to 5 pages of text and pictures. The majority of this text just describes scenes from the movie. Now, the question is A) If you havnt watched one of the movies why would you spoil it by reading about its scenes? and B) If you have watched one of the movies why would you read a description of something you've already seen? The sections of the book that are unlike this a very short and hardly worth looking at. To me this seems like a cofee-table book, only much longer, and less usefull.",132
0,Kind of creepy,"I give it 2 stars only because it was free. The illustrations are poor, and the 'poems' are pretty awful. it says on the back cover, in all caps,""WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND"" I think that's pretty creepy for a preschooler's book.

0,Just not enjoyable,"Having finished the first 2 installments in this series I can safely say I won't be finishing it. It is difficult to read because of the lack of plot and the use of ""big"" words you haven't seen since the SAT. While you can infer the meaning of most of the words based on the context of the sentence it is still very annoying.The first 2 books are essentially descriptive imagery of the places and people Severian happens to meet on his completely random and meaningless journey. There is no adventure or character development - just an endless stream of bizarre imagery interlaced with hidden references to present day Earth and ancient myths. Maybe the point of this story is revealed in books 3 and 4, but I don't care to find out.",133

1,great for kids,I ordered this boxed set for my 10 year old niece for christmas and she loved it. It was an ideal gift since it is a boxed set and all the volumes are in one place. It was great to order a reading gift of a boxed set of volumes instead of ordering one volume at a time and having to remember which one the already have. The books are great for 'kid readers' as well as adults. This was a great way to get a child who is already into reading to read more and to appreciate reading and owning a set of volumes.,105

1,"So far, so good","This compact, reduced power oil filled heater has performed well after three months: no leaking, no odor, only a soft pitter-patter when the heat cuts back. It has numerous controls: a clock timer, a temperature dial AND toggle switches so the heater can be run at 500 watts, 700 watts or the 1200 watt combination. These switches are illuminated, a nice touch. It heats strongly at the higher dial settings, the slits at the top of the coils helping the heat to come out faster though in a vertical direction.This design is good for homes with pets or small children who could injure themselves touching an exposed heating element. Follow the instructions to burn off the initial coating in a ventilated environment and you will never have an unpleasant smell.",130

True, Nintendo intends to make some Gamecube games available for download onto the WiiU, but that doesn't mean that all Gamecube games will be available. Best to hold on just to be sure.When you get controllers like these, though, always go with Nintendo-made products; all the others look very similar but you can feel right away the response times are not as sharp. And then later on, you'll see that quality is not as good when the controller breaks a month later (true story).

0,Lack of depth,"This dominican telenovela, sorry, ""movie"", is unfortunately an heavy-weighted political manifesto which lacks of subtility ans psychology. Two parts are typical in this sense: the police scene with the young brother (associating ""freedom"" and ""listening to north american pop music"") and the final one, quite ridiculous for me, but certainly fantasmatic when the sun warms some white hairless heads near the playa Giron, sorry, Bay of Pigs monument in the Calle Ocho. A recent cuban movie, Life is to Whistle, was as critical as Bitter Sugar, but expressed its ideas in a more inspired and cultured way. The director seems to ignore that Cuba is not Sweden (or perhaps it's another fantasm), since all the characters, including our ""heroes"", are blancos como el coco.",124

0,Very contrived and totally uninteresting,I was so disappointed in this movie. It was like a film 101 project. Someone had an outline of what an epic movie should be and they just went down the outline executing each point. Nicole Kidman wasn't the least bit believable in this role. So stiff and mechanical. It seems she was just in it for the paycheck and the typical Kidman in bed shots. I really wanted to like Hugh Jackman but he was just there for scenery and didn't contribute much to the film. There was absolutely no chemistry between Kidman and Jackman.The mysticism throughout the movie was a distraction and did not fit in the movie at all. The young boy and the king were the only two interesting characters. Save 165 minutes of your life and watch something else.,134

The most important function of a coffee press is to separate the grounds from the drink. This coffee press completely failed in that function.Both on medium grind coffee grounds and loose Chinese tea, the press allowed a significant amount of material to pass.For example, 1 mm thick tea branches floated up past the silicone sides.The basic problem is poor design: despite good quality plastics and metal stem, the silicone border is not rigid enough and not large enough to grip the cylinder wall.

Okay, thanks for giving me an example of relative velocity without telling me what it is or how to solve for it. This book is incredibly frustrating.I do not recommend it.",83

According to the D-Link warranty info, I needed to have a Case ID number from an online tech who would first walk me through troubleshooting procedures. We needed an immediate router solution. I never did get around to uninstalling the new router so I could reinstall the non-functioning D-Link and call the D-Link tech support to get the required Case ID number. I'm not a computer novice so I'm sure the problem was with the D-Link router malfunctioning, particularly since nothing in the environment had changed and the new Linksys router resolved the problem. Plus, I would have had to pay for shipping the D-Link back to the manufacturer. Just wasn't worth the time, cost and hassle. The D-Link EBR 2310 was a disappointment.

0,I hope this isn't their best,"I picked this album up after hearing about this band from a friend. He described it as a viking themed death metal band. Well, that's the last time I listen to his recommendations. This is an average at best death metal release. ""The One Insane"" and ""Execute Them All"" are fun songs, but the album as a whole isn't worth your money. It's not really brutal or interesting in any way, and the vocals are some of the worst death vocals out there. The band's cover of ""Breaking the Law"" is a joke at best. I gave it two stars because it's at least tolerable to listen to. Hopefully thier other albums are better then this one.",117

1,Very Relaxing,"The title of this CD is quite misleading. I bought it because I thought it would be Blues. It is not. It's lounge music--though of a high order. If I had liked the MUSIC better, I would rate this CD 5 stars; nevertheless, it still gets 4 stars, on the strength of other good qualitites. This CD is well-recorded, with both good musical detail and a sonic warmth or lushness. This is an intimate recording of tranquil piano and voice. The result, at least for me, is immediate relaxation.Is this CD relaxing merely because it's boring? I don't think so (even though I do find the music bland). Rather, I think it's relaxing because it sounds warm, lush and intimate. Most ""boring"" music is therefore ""annoying,"" but this CD is relaxing. Sometimes you want music you can sing along with or otherwise actively listen to; but there are other times when you just want to relax, and this CD will accomplish that. (Of course, YOU might also like the songs themselves. I hope so.)",174

Although the cinematography was wonderful, the writing was terrible. Transitions were abrupt and nonsensical. The attempt to combine a chronological structure with a topical one, made the end result choppy. The reuse and over use of the same footage got to be annoying. I thought I was going to get an inside view, and although there was some behind the scenes footage, it wasn't enough to justify the title. It would have been better to have stuck with a true behnd the scenes look at the current Grand Central, and forget the history. Or, conversely, give the history and forget the behind the scenes.

1,The persecution of Christians?,"Who cares about the persecution of Christians? Historically, Christianity has persecuted and killed more people than any other religion on earth (crusades, spanish conquests, protestants vs. catholics, etc.) I think Western Christians have a serious problem with self-examination, and it needs to be addressed.

If, for instance, I could still regard the CIA as a credible agency and not a useless, terrible joke I might have found the premise of a dynamic, competent CIA agent believable. Since the average CIA agent has been proven to be an inept bureaucrat the entire concept of the book is laughable. Add the typical liberal viewpoint of anything conservative and you just have a pale, lifeless version of LaCarre. Too bad since based on ""Unlikely Spy"" I thought I was going to like Silva's books.",109

1,"Nice sound for the price, but a little bulky","I'm probably not adding anything new, but I'll state my opinion anyway. These headphones have great sound and block out ambient sounds very well. I don't like ear buds, so the over the ear design is great for me, but this of course means the headset is pretty big and bulky. It doesn't fold up very small either, the ear cups just rotate so that they can lay flat. I love pairing these headphones with my smartphone (Moto Q9c) to listen to streaming radio or mp3s. The Bluetooth works great; it's reliable, easy to pair, and sounds great. The built in mic isn't high quality, but it's decent enough for when someone interrupts your jam session by actually calling you on your phone (the nerve of some people).",128

As a lot of people have said they won't be buying this and any future Ultimate Editions unless the Extended versions of each film are included and I agree with them. The first two HP films I purchased the Ultimate Editions mainly because the Extended Cuts were included along with the theatrical versions. Adding only a documentary is not reason enough to shell out 40 bucks or more for the same movie I already have on blu-ray.The first two Ultimate Editions are truly beautiful sets. The artwork and all the extras really make these collector's items for any fan of this series and I was looking forward to purchasing all the films (again) on blu-ray. However, as much as I'd love to have these now, without the Extended Cuts, makes all the difference.I hope someone at WB with enough clout sees this thread and hopefully some day soon we will be able to purchase THE truly ULTIMATE EDITIONS of ALL of the Harry Potter films.",167

From then I have had a great craving to hear more of this sui generis performer. It is finally satisfied by this CD. Here you can get a serious overdose of slide guitar stylings, with fidelity so good you can hear every scraping of the slide, and every picking artifact. For a driving exciting tune, you can't beat Locust Hill Rag, and for metal, listen to The Caissons Go Rolling Along. No one else in the whole world has combined Cherokee culture with Hawaiian music, so you better give a good listen to both versions of ""Hillbilly Hula.""

Only real flaw is the stickers are peeling off some of the lids and I have to keep rubbing them back on but it's not working and there weren't enough pre-made ones so I had to write in a few, I'll be peeling them all off and writing with silver sharpie on all the lids for a uniform look.",119

1,Must Read,"There are some books, which leave a lasting impression on you. The kind that you start to miss before you are even done, and then when you finish, you can't read another for a while. This is that kind of book. The story follows a number of people caught up in the various sides of the Drug War, a DEA agent, coke traffickers call girl, mafiosos and a priest. The most compelling part of the story is the humanity of each character. This is not just another book with plot twists-it also makes you feel what each person is feeling. Recommend Highly",102

He says that decisions can change your life in an instant and gives examples of people who have made important decisions and concludes that decisions can change your life. He gives no strategy for improving your decision-making skills besides ""make more decisions"". He does seem to have a lot of energy, which can be motivational. I'm going to guess that the motivational component is what is getting his high ratings, but I don't think the strategies he gives are very good.",126

I was hoping that the Legend Films release had something more to offer regarding the black and white original version, mainly better subtitles that don't wash out in some scenes, along with a better translation in some scenes as well. The colorized version sucks [like all colorized versions], plain and simple - truncated by 50 minutes to 90 minutes in length, English dubbed, and is not the same experience as watching Passdolini's original vision. It simply represents everything that is wrong with Christian marketing these days - the compromise of artistic integrity for a quick buck. Had Legend Films brought us a truly better print in all its black and white glory with some bonafide extras I could easily overlook the release's shortcomings. Hopefully down the road this masterpiece will get the treatment [Criterion, preferably] it deserves.",150
1,Nice Accessory,"This is a great tool for those shots where you want to get down low. Macro work and landscape/waterscape shots near the ground are so much easier with the angle finder on than without. I have also used it when doing portrait work to get a more flattering angle without having to kneel or stoop over the whole time.Now for the negative. It fogs up much easier than the normal eyepiece, which makes seeing anything a challenge under some conditions. And the big one for me, especially with macro work, you loose some light when using the angle finder. So if you are already working in a low-light situation, this only makes matters worse.But in well-lit conditions where fogging is not an issue and you want to shoot low, this is an amazing accessory, thus the 4 out of 5 stars.",141
0,Soundtrack? Not exactly. . .,"For those of you wondering what that great blues number is at the beginning of this movie, it's a song called ""Hard Workin' Man"" performed by Captain Beefheart. This song was originally written for a movie called ""Blue Collar"" and can be found on the new Beefheart anthology ""The Dust Blows Forward"" from Rhino.Pretty entertaining movie if you're into lawyers and such. Too bad they didn't bother to put any of the good blues cuts from it on the soundtrack. Oh well, that's showbiz. . .",86

1,One of the best books around,"This book is just one of the best books I have read in a long while. It really kept me intersted and I felt as if I were right there experiencing every pain and happiness that her family felt through the whole ordeal. I live in the same area as Jessica Lynch and know a lot of people who know her personally, and every word that is in that book about her and her family and the whole community is absolutely true to the ""T"". The author did such a tremendous job writing her story. I think anyone who has negative attitudes towards how much Jessica Lynch is in the media and about how she is being called a ""hero"", needs to read this book and I think their whole outlook on the whole situation will change. It is a definate must read.",143
0,Greatest idea and poorest execution I've seen in a while,I bought five of these and of these only two are in operation. 3 of them simply don't work with the same lamp as the other 2 that don't work (failing a 'known-good' test). If you look at the metal leads they are exposed and look like they were assembled by a 2nd grader. I've only written a couple of reviews on Amazon over the year but I really feel cheated here :( I'm too lazy to find the boxes and send them back as they were so cheap.,89
0,Grainy Picture Indoors - Loud Motor Noise,"I purchased this last week and returned it. The picture (compared to Sony TRV22 in the same lighting) was TERRIBLE! So grainy it looked like a digital effect. I tried all the settings, different tapes and alternate lighting and couldn't get a decent picture.The motor noise is loud compared to 2 other DV camcorders I have owned. So loud it picked up on the mic and transferred to VHS. Not impressed with this, ...If you get this camcorder, save your receipt until you've tested it!!!",85

1,My favorite move,"The first time I saw this movie, as a sophmore in college, I was mesmerized. The wondrous way Truffaut moved the camera! The heartbreaking story of a boy who's neglected, hardened, and turned into a delinquent. The film is also an indictment of parental and other authorities. I've seen the movie over a dozen times, and have found new insights each time. This film will appeal to anyone with aesthetic sensibilities--writers (like me), painters, would-be filmmakers, musicians, whatever. It's simply the best film I've ever seen--far better than Citizen Kane. This is a film to be studied, and enjoyed again and again for its savage beauty.",106

0,Good headphones but not for noise canceling,"I rated these 1 star because they did not satisfy the reason I purchased them ... primarily to cancel out engine noise while flying. While they do give you decent sound from your music device, the open-ear design pretty much negates the noise canceling function. I have owned noise-canceling headphones before, Sony. These were closed ear design and did a much better job of canceling engine drone and other low frequencies, tho I had the same annoying problem with crackling and popping when I moved that everyone else seems to have experienced. Bottomline, do not purchase these if your goal is to reduce air travel noise.",106

0,"Xenophobia, and a desire to get in with Stalin","Alexander Nevsky has a huge and undeserved reputation as a film. As a film, it is a tour de force of editing and montage - the cinematography for the time is absolutely stunning, and is set among scenes that give the film its mythic properties. However, the score by Sergei Prokofiev wobbles from very good (nearly as compelling as the ballets) to laughable. It's the film's overwhelming political context that kills it, however.Eisenstein made this film to please Stalin. As such, it is xenophobic, Rus in the extreme, and portrays the Russians as surrounded by hated and unredeemable enemies. This is the usual us-versus-them that justifies dictatorship. The speeches and posturing are all you would expect of government dominated art.this review also submitted to netflix",125

1,"""Old Hollywood"" alive and well in the 1980s","The late great William Overgard wrote and drew this strip for two years concurrently with his work on the ""Steve Roper & Mike Nomad"" strip. There was a bit more whimsy and charm to his work here, in contrast to the urban, street-smart atmosphere in ""Roper & Nomad."" There is a noticable simplicity to the ink work on ""Rudy"" compared to ""Roper"", which works just fine. Overgard shows off his virtuosity at drawing sexy women and classic autos, as well as the streets of LA. As a lifelong fan of the vastly underrated Bill Overgard, I can't convey how much I adore this book. My only regret is that there was never a second volume reprinting the final year of the strip.",122
1,Great product,I love this product. We have cats who like to jump on the TV stand and try to rub along the TV. These strips are two sided and are actually clear (the packaging makes them look like they are white) so they disappear on the furniture. The stand I use them on is glass so I can't speak to whether or not they will damage wood or other materials. But they have done the trick and the cats don't jump on the table anymore. Will definitely use them again.,89

If you don't want to strain your brain and you want the story to float effortlessly from the pages into your brain, this is the novel for you. As for me, this book is typical of the trash written these days. I guess it's because I like to read stories which are plausible. I like to get some insight into the thinking of people who live very differently from me. But every now and then I enjoy easy trash, although I am not proud of that fact.",120
0,jittery and awful,"The product discription and picture give an impression of a tranquil winter snow scene. There is little of that. Most of it is herky-jerky vertigo-inducing helicopter views that constantly jump and jitter from one shot to the next. The transitions are far, far too frequent and very jarring and abrupt. We are also 'treated' to many shots of another helicopter. Why they thought this would be enjoyable is a complete mystery to me, likewise the intrusive bands of skiers that pop up hither thither at random. Overall I truly detest this dvd and will be giving it away to Goodwill or somesuch. Further there is no option to simply hear the wind. All soundtracks are various blah renditions of music as listed in another review. Overall this dvd is a complete waste of money, unless perhaps you want to pretend you are hang-gliding while bouncing in and out of consciousness. ;-)",151
1,great little fryer,"I bought this deep fryer for my husband as a birthday gift. We have had so much fun deep frying! Last night it was chicken nuggets for the kids and batter dipped veggies for us. Friends stopped by right after we finished cooking and agreed the food was delicious. Some words of advice, only use the basket with frozen foods, otherwise the batter sticks to the sides of it. With non frozen items, just drop the food in the hot oil.You may wish to pick up a wire scoop to dish food out. A good dipping sauce we found is a combination of mayonaise and honey. Overall, it's an easy fryer to use at a great price. It produces yummy food and is lots of fun!",126
1,Dean James--Outstanding Sax,"I first heard the title track about 4 years ago on the Public Jazz station--KTSU, Houston, Tx. And I searched records stores from the west coast to the UK trying to find this album. It's that good. Also, other very nice and mellow cuts include 'Round the Horn, ""Skylight"", ""Anytime Anyplace"", and ""Lost without your Lovin"". Besides ""Can we talk"" any listener will be definitely groove to ""Lay your hands on me"" and ""What kind of love isThis."" Just hit the open road, open the moon roof, put on this cd and drive.--Dean is currently playing in Houston and I hope he stays a long time.--",106
1,One of his best!!!!,"I own every CD of Takemura since Scope (except Finale) and Milano is one of his best! It's much different from his more abstract work, so it's hard to compare them.All in all, this is some of the most beautiful music I've ever heard! His masterful compositions maintain the childlike sound of his standard instrument choices, but take it to a much higher level of beauty and emotion that isn't touched in works like Water's Suite or the more abstract tracks of Scope.If you're unsure about spending [the money] on this very very hard to find import and want to know more about the CD's sound, listen to Hoshi No Koe. Tracks like ""One Day,"" ""White Sheep and Small Light,"" and ""In the Room-Roof-Wood"" capsulate much of the same mood and atmosphere that Milano flawlessly maintains!It's not dance and it's not conceptual or abstract. It's just plain beautiful! (I can't say that enough)",153
0,Not fully functional with Digital SLR cameras,"This lens is described in the product description as an auto-focus that will work on digital SLR cameras. While the lens is technically an ""auto-focus lens"" it is misleading. If you have a digital SLR camera youR lens has a switch on the side that allows the camera to focus the lens when you press the photo button. This lens does not do that. On a digital SLR camera it is just a manual focus lens. I called the seller and they wanted to argue that the lens was auto-focus but did agree to allow me to return the lens. So while the lens was new and the size specified, my complaint is that the description misleads you into thinking that this is a fully autofocus lens compatible and fully functional on digital SLR cameras such as my Nikon D40 it is not.",143
0,"Nice idea, but poor longevity","I bought this about a month ago because my apartment has lead pipes and this is one of the best values in filters certified to remove lead. The filter is activated by pulling a small metal knob. When you turn off the water, the filter is supposed to automatically deactivate itself. This feature broke within 2 weeks of use. It's annoying and more importantly increases the potential for damage to the filter when you forget that it's still switched on and run hot water through it (water over ~105 F will permanently damage the filter cartridge).",96

I feel honored to have these 2 videos now, my residents love them both. Anthony Burger was the best, & always will be the best. What more can be said about such a God Given Talent such as he. I'm sure the Lord must have wanted him for something else, as he took him home at such an early age. But his life & music legacy will live on forever.

0,Deserted Island,"Michael Bay's ""The Island"" was the whipping boy for the disastrous summer movie season that was 2005. Filled with lots of action and talented actors in the form of Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannsen the filmed promised to be a huge event film but winded up being a box office bomb. The reason easily is the story.Others have elaborated on the story here so I need not give another summary. What I did feel while watching this film was that whoever wrote the script borrowed heavily from ""logan's Run"" and 80's thriller ""Coma"" with just a dash of Lucas'""THX"" to create a convoluted, heavy-handed, cheesy hollywood mess about the dangers of cloning and the individual.The actors gave it their best to save this film and Michael Bay blew up everything to get the male audience in the seats. In the end though ""The Island"" deserved to be the summer's movie whipping boy because it exemplifies why people didnt go that much this summer- we've seen the story (done better) before.",170
0,How can a cable go wrong?,"There was a review from another customer for an identical Scosche cable that only received a one-star rating. I thought the customer who left that review/rating was just unlucky, so I took a risk and got one. I mean how can a cable be defective? Well, I was sure wrong...lightning must have struck twice because mine was a complete defect like that other unfortunate customer. The cable didn't eliminate noise...it increased it! There was static, buzzing, and zapping noises... I don't know what was going on--maybe electrical shocks/pulses?--but my mp3 player kept blinking back and forth from track to track, voice record, FM tuner, etc; didn't feel good. I'll never buy any audio cables from Scosche again.",117

I read dozens of books about cold war and espionage and I would have to put this in bottom 3. Unless you enjoy unrealistic Star wars type fiction this book is not for you..,88
0,Very Little That's New,"Not a bad read if you're a fan, although it's mostly a mashup of reviews, with very little comment from the author himself. It concentrates excessively on the early (""original"") Mothers albums which is really a very small subset of Frank's overall output. Very little content about Frank or his family, and disasters like the breakup of the 1988 touring band are glossed over in a paragraph or two.",69
0,Not Worth The Money,"The only thing good about this product is the applicator. The software that comes with it is horrible. First of all, the printer alignment feature doesn't work, so it is impossible to align you graphics onto the paper so they will never be centered. And even the neat feature (which I thought) of having the words in circlular pattern around the outer edge of the CD looks fine on the screen but is ""squashed"" on the paper and looks horrible next to the unaligned picture graphic. Do NOT buy this product until a new version is out without all these bugs.",101

0,banal and dated,This Hugo award winning novel shows its age. Characters are using slide rules and fingerprints to prove their points. Not to mention the Martians running around Earth and Mars. Very talky not much else going on. Lots of fiction very little science or imagination. More of a character study of a man's blossoming from a self-centered oaf to a world leader. Really a pretty basic fish out of water becomes a hero story. Not a whole lot of literary value here. I consider this book a waste of time. Not even a good escape novel.,95
1,"You won't regret this book, hoss...","""Waylon: An Autobiography"" is a very honest, straight shooting account of the life of Waylon Jennings. I found it to be an interesting read that's well written.This book covers Waylon's life all the way from a dirt floor in Texas to the 1990s. I found the part about his time with Buddy Holly fascinating. I always heard Waylon was supposed to be on the plane, but I never knew the profound impact missing the flight had on him. That chapter alone was worth the price of the book. It takes us through the glory days of the '70s and the outlaw years all the way through the struggles of the '80s. Toward the end of the book, he discusses The Highwaymen at great length. Throughout, it is honest, frank, and pure Waylon.This is a book worth reading for anybody that's a country music fan. It's well done, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.",152
1,There Will Be Blood,"Possibly the most frightening book I've read, The Hot Zone seamlessly combines horror, medical drama, and politics into one. Although the sections detailing the violent disease related deaths can get a bit gory and graphic at times, the book is never overwhelming as Preston intertwines the science and the story.The book reads easily and never losses its touch. I found all of the parts equally entertaining but especially enjoyed the whole Virginia deal (seems to ever more satisfying with all of this swine flu business). In the end I would recommend The Hot Zone to any one in need of a little near disaster.",104
0,Sensational and biased,"This got 2 stars because, for a long time, this was the only book about the West Memphis Three case. A much superior book, ""Devil's Knot"" has been released recently andI recommend that over Blood of Innocents. For the most part, this book is written from the official perspective that Damien, Jason and Jessie are guilty of the crimes they were convicted of. It focuses heavily on the writings of Damien Echols which prove nothing except that he was a disturbed teen while ignoring or glossing over the evidence pointing away from the three. This is your garden variety true crime book full of lurid detail but little substance.",109
0,A poor effort....,"I read this as a thirteen year old boy and enjoyed it. A re-read twenty years later gave me a different perspective. MacLeans dialogue between his characters is comic book variety at best. There are also a few glaring errors that I am surprised that his editor did not pick up on, two of note: Shaffer (supposedly from Montana) is credited with a Mid-West accent?? Montana is far west not 'mid' west. Secondly, Nazi helicopters? This is just plain sloppy. MacLean should have known much better.This one belongs on the bookshelf of a teenage boy. For a better read of MacLeans better works I reccomend; HMS Ulysess and Bear Island. The characters are far more credible and provide a better story by far. A poor effort by Mr MacLean.",129

1,Excellent one-volume treatment,"The Civil War is such a vast subject (I believe the most written about event in human history) that it's hard to know where to start. I'm not an expert on the war, but I found this read to be very satisfying. I don't know how much more time I'll devote to the Civil War, but it seems to me that this book provides an excellent overview of the event and is everything a nonspecialist lay reader like myself could want to know. I've read great words of praise for Shelby Foote's trilogy, so maybe I'll take on that project some day, but if I don't, I'll feel like McPherson gave me a solid understanding of the causes, major players, and main political struggles surrounding this terrible period in our nation's history. I can't add too much more to the other excellent reviews here, but I thought I'd add another five-star review and hope others take the time to read this well-written survey of our Civil War.",167
0,Diane Arbus in Cinematic Hell,"""Fur"" takes the fascinating subject of Diane Arbus and trashes it. Ignoring Patricia Bosworth's 1984 biography, director Steven Shainberg and screenwriter Erin Cressida Wilson opt for a pretentious fictional approach.

1,Great Salvatore/Drizzt book series...,"The Legacy of the Drow is a great series and fantastic addition to the Drizzt legend (may it never end!). You may consider this review sided - I have loved all of the Salvatore-Drizzt books leading up to this - but this series is one of the best. Great surprises, great new characters, introduction of old characters you thought you might never see again, and overall superb storytelling and character development. I recommend reading the books leading up to this series (Homeland, Exile, Sojourn, The Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver, and The Halfling's Gem) so you can understand what's going on with all the characters, story-arcs, etc., but Salvatore does a nice job of explaining reintroduced characters and concepts enough that new readers would understand what's going on.",128

0,"Good on concepts, lacking on examples","With high hopes, I bought this book. But it has been a big disappointment. The book explains the concepts of OLE DB templates and the various macros, quite well. Lot of figures explaining the relationship between objects. But it is very much lacking on real usable examples. There is not a single complete example. Most examples are real simple. Inserts and Deletes get just one page each, hardly useful, and also the example used for these is with a CTable. How many people use a CTable for inserts and deletes? It is like saying ""Delete/Update the first row in the database"", which is hardly practical. There are about 30 OLE DB types, but no examples on how to use these. In summary, the book is better than the SDK documentation on OLE DB templates, but not much useful if you want to get into OLE DB programming quickly.",148
